## 0930 Head First HTML5 Programming — Study Log #1 

#### Chapter 1. Getting to Know HTML5: Welcome to Webville

- HTML5 is markup + JavaScript APIs + CSS (unofficial answer)
- Many of the new features in HTML5 require JavaScript to make the most of them.
- Using JavaScript, you can interact with the DOM—the Document Object Model.
- The DOM is the browser’s internal representation of a web page. Using JavaScript, you can access elements, change elements, and add new elements to the DOM.
- A JavaScript API is an “Application Programming Interface.” APIs make it possible to control all aspects of HTML5, like 2D drawing, video playback, and more.
