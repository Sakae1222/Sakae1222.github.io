## 0903 Pose director, web developer, reader

>No man is crushed by misfortune unless he has first been deceived by prosperity.  
>— Seneca

💭 After some reflection, I decided to spend more time on HTML and CSS instead of reading too many books, and then move on to JavaScript.

🖥️ **09:15** Started learning HTML and CSS Chapter 8

👧 **10:00** The model came to our office today for the photoshoot — I totally forgot!

✈️ Directed model poses until **11:10**

🖥️ **11:35** Completed Chapter 8 

🖥️ **15:50** Completed Chapter 9 and wrote [Study Log #7](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/09/03/studylog.html)

📖 **16:10** Started reading *So Good They Can't Ignore You* Chapter 7-11

>**Notes:**
>
>When you are acquiring career capital in a field, you can imagine that you are acquiring this capital in a specific type of **career capital market**.
>There are two types of these markets: **winner-take-all** and **auction**.
>
>**To build a deliberate practice strategy**  
>Step 1: Decide What Capital Market You’re In
>Step 2: Identify Your Capital Type
>Step 3: Define “Good”
>Step 4: Stretch and Destroy
>Step 5: Be Patient
>
>It helps to think about skill acquisition like a freight train: Getting it started requires a huge application of effort, but changing its track once it’s moving is easy.
>
>If you’re not uncomfortable, then you’re probably stuck at an “acceptable level.”
>
>Pushing past what’s comfortable, however, is only one part of the deliberate-practice story; the other part is embracing honest feedback—even if it destroys what you thought was good. 
>
>Rule #3: Turn Down a Promotion (or the importance of control)
>
>You have to get good before you can expect good work.
>
>Giving people more control over what they do and how they do it increases their happiness, engagement, and sense of fulfillment.
>
>The First Control Trap: Control that’s acquired without career capital is not sustainable.
>
>Money is a neutral indicator of value. By aiming to make money, you’re aiming to be valuable — hobbies are clearly exempt from this rule.

📖 **17:25** Finished reading Chapter 11
