## 0815 

Yesterday I finally finished reading *The Psychology of Money*. It made me feel at ease.   
I also fixed my Kindle library by deleting the books I no longer want to read.

↪️ Today I worked on renaming my blogs and polishing the titles until **09:30**.

Then I started reading *The Attention Merchants*.
