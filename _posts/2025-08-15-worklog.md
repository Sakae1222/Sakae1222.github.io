## 0815 Reading and finally did some work

Yesterday I finally finished reading *The Psychology of Money*. It made me feel at ease.   
I also fixed my Kindle library by deleting the books I no longer want to read.  
And here's an article about what not to read — [*You Don't Have Time to Read Books That Won't Change Your Life*](https://aethermug.com/posts/you-don-t-have-time).

↪️ Worked on renaming my blogs and polishing the titles until **09:30**

🖋️ **10:00** Wrote a blog in Chinese [about running](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/08/15/thinking.html)

👩‍💼 **10:30** Edited some photos using Photoshop

💭 I realized that the computer we are using at home now is not good enough for me.  
🤑 So I think I want to buy an iMac or Mac mini before my girlfriend's graduation, when I can use her student discount to get my new computer at a lower price.

💭 **13:10** It was too cold; how could 24 degrees Celsius be so cold?

🔍 **14:10** Did some research on what I should read on Kindle and found [a recommendation list from Amazon](http://politics.people.com.cn/n/2015/0818/c70731-27481186.html).  
💬 Through talking with Claude (and deleting Japanese books I can read in Japanese myself, as well as books written by Chinese male authors), I decided to read *1984* first on my Kindle.  
😸 Coincidentally, I had just started reading it yesterday.

📖 **16:05** Finished reading *The Attention Merchants* Chapter 2

👩‍💼 **16:30** Made a flyer draft using Illustrator

I remember that when I was a high school student, I wrote my goal as becoming a linguist.  
So maybe I should read [some books about linguistics](https://www.lindsaydoeslanguages.com/10-inspiring-books-about-language-and-linguistics/).  
>[What books would recommend for a layman to read about linguistics (not textbooks)?](https://www.reddit.com/r/linguistics/comments/9i2ud6/what_books_would_recommend_for_a_layman_to_read/)

🏄‍♀️ Surfed until the end of the workday this week.
