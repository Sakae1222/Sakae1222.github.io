## 0819 No-boss days make me so happy and relaxed

Today I woke up before my alarm clock again, alone. 
It’s the second day since my babe went to Hiroshima for a seminar—with her new hair color.

After work today, I want to go to the Bleach event and see if there are any cool goods I want to buy. 
I won’t have time for a full workout, but I can still stretch and do some suburi on the balcony.

>**Notes:**
>
>The very word “propaganda” originally had a strictly ecclesiastical meaning of propagating the faith.
>
>Any communication is potentially propagandistic, in the sense of propagating a view.
>For it presents one set of facts, or one perspective, fostering or weakening some “stereotype” held by the mind.
>
>In most areas of life, we necessarily rely on others for the presentation of facts and ultimately choose between manufactured alternatives, whether it is our evaluation of a product or a political proposition.
>And if that is true, in the battle for our attention, there is a particular importance in who gets there first or most often.
>The only communications truly without influence are those that one learns to ignore or never hears at all; this is why Jacques Ellul argued that it is only the disconnected—rural dwellers or the urban poor—who are truly immune to propaganda,
>while intellectuals, who read everything, insist on having opinions, and think themselves immune to propaganda are, in fact, easy to manipulate.
>
>hose who won our independence believed that the final end of the State was to make men free to develop their faculties, and that, in its government, the deliberative forces should prevail over the arbitrary.
>They valued liberty both as an end, and as a means. They believed liberty to be the secret of happiness, and courage to be the secret of liberty.
>They believed that freedom to think as you will and to speak as you think are means indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth;
>that, without free speech and assembly, discussion would be futile; that, with them, discussion affords ordinarily adequate protection against the dissemination of noxious doctrine.

📖 **14:15** Finished reading *The Attention Merchants* Chapter 3

😪 **15:00** Felt sleepy 

💡 **15:50** Searched for Obsidian daily templates and found [Dann's blog](https://dannb.org/blog/2022/obsidian-daily-note-template/), which is full of useful articles. I’ll read them over the next few days.

😆 I’m so excited because Obsidian Bases is such a useful plugin, just like everyone says.
