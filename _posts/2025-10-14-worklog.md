## 1014 Chill day after a project (passing the IT Passport exam)

📆 I passed the IT Passport exam last weekend, which made me feel more confident, and I plan to take the SG exam on **December 14th**.

😫 Feel terribly tired and can’t even breathe well

📖 **11:15** Started reading *Four Thousand Weeks* Chapter 4 *Becoming a Better Procrastinator*

>**Notes:**
>
>The core challenge of managing our limited time isn’t about how to get everything done – that’s never going to happen – but how to decide most wisely what not to do, and how to feel at peace about not doing it.
>
>The real measure of any time management technique is whether or not it helps you neglect the right things.
>
>Principle number one is to pay yourself first when it comes to time.    
>The second principle is to limit your work in progress.  
>The third principle is to resist the allure of middling priorities. 
>
>Since every real-world choice about how to live entails the loss of countless alternative ways of living, there’s no reason to procrastinate, or to resist making commitments, in the anxious hope that you might somehow be able to avoid those losses.
>**Loss is a given.**


📰 **13:45** Read Dense Discovery [#360](https://www.densediscovery.com/issues/360)

😆 Found a website called [Kaomoji Cool Club](https://kaomojicool.club/) where I can make my own emojis and copy and paste them ʕ๑𝌂⨼𝌂๑ʔ

💢 **15:50** The boss yelled again and again, which made me feel awful.

🖥️ **17:10** Finished a CodeCamp course

📘 **17:20** Finished reading Chapter 4 and started organizing my reading notes
