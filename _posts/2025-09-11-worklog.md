## 0911 Recovering little by little each day

After taking two days off, I'm back at work. My throat hasn’t completely recovered yet, but it’s better than the past few days.
I hope I can keep this condition today and start to feel even better.

I generated some pictures with AI and edited some photos in Photoshop.

😪 I felt sleepy so quickly after I started reading.

🍜 I went to the shopping street and ate udon for lunch.
