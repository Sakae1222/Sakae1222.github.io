## 0220 Started a new book and did some SPI practice

🖱️ Did some work

💭 I’ll use the whole afternoon to practice SPI. Before that, I want to read a book.

🔖 **11:45** Finished reading *Holes* part one 4

✏️ Practiced SPI, I think I can handle it

📖 Continued reading the book

👩‍💼 I will change my career this year!

🔖 **15:55** Finished reading part one 5
