## 0924 Reserving Expo tickets is driving me crazy

These days I’ve been getting up early to try booking Expo tickets, but the system is a complete mess. Every time I almost get through, an error page pops up. 
Tomorrow I have to take a bus to Tokyo, which means I’ll be logging into that awful site on the highway. 
I’m so nervous—if I can’t make the reservation, my money will be gone… damn it.
I don’t know if the shit site will just ban me tomorrow. What should I do?

>You will invariably take in more opportunities than your system can process on a daily basis.
>
>Trying to create goals before you have confidence that you can keep your everyday world under control will often undermine your motivation and energy rather than enhance them.

>**Notes:**
>
>One of the best ways to increase your energy is to close some of your loops. So always be sure to have some easy loops to close, right at hand.
>
> I recommend that you make and keep a list called “**Areas of Focus**.”
>You might like to separate this into “Professional” and “Personal” sublists, in which case you’ll want to use them both equally for a consistent review.
>This is one of the most useful checklists you can create for your own self-management.
>It won’t require the kind of once-a-week recalibration that the Projects list will; more likely it will have meaning on a longer recursion cycle.
>Depending on the speed of change in some of the more important areas of your life and work, this should be used as a trigger for potential new projects every one to three months.
>
>If you’re involved in anything that has a future of longer than a year (marriage, kids, career, a company, an art form, a lifelong passion), you would do well to think about what you might need to be doing to manage things along that vector.  
>Questions to ask are:
>- What are the longer-term goals and objectives in my organization, and what projects do I need to have in place related to them to fulfill my responsibilities?
>- What longer-term goals and objectives have I set for myself, and what projects do I need to have in place to make them happen?
>- What other significant things are happening that could affect my options about what I’m doing?

🤯 There are too many things in my head: the Expo ticket booking, my trip home, and even tomorrow’s bus ticket...  
💭 I made a list of these things and prayed I could fix them one by one.
