## 0922 Changed background color, did some work, and read GTD

>So you must match time’s swiftness with your speed in using it, and you must drink quickly as though from a rapid stream that will not always flow.  
>— Seneca

☑️ There’s nothing to do today, so I’m going to read some books, learn how to write reading notes, do a summary of last week, and maybe try changing the CSS style of my blog.

💭 Next weekend, I will participate in a kendo competition. It will be my second time joining a team competition, and I hope I can do my best and not trouble my teammates.  
**I think it’s better if I train on Wednesday and Friday.**

📖 **09:45** Started reading *GTD*

>**Notes:**
>
>**It’s a great habit to date everything you handwrite**
>
>**Consider whether your collectible and nostalgia items are still meaningful to you.**
>
> When you’re in processing mode, you must get into the habit of starting at one end and just cranking through items one at a time, in order.
>As soon as you break that rule and process only what you feel like processing, in whatever order, you’ll invariably begin to leave things unprocessed.
>
>**The in-tray is a processing station, not a storage bin.**
>
>Processing all the things in your world will make you more conscious of what you are going to do and what you should not be doing.
>
>It’s important that you record the date on everything that you hand off to others. This, of all the categories in your personal system, is the most crucial one to keep tabs on.
>The few times you will actually want to refer to that information (“But I called and ordered that on March 12”) will make it worth establishing this as a lifelong habit.
>
>Again, I define **a project as any outcome you’re committed to achieving that will take more than one action step to complete**.
>
>**seven primary types of things that you’ll want to keep track of and manage**  
>- A Projects list
>- Project support material
>- Calendar actions and information
>- Next Actions lists
>- A Waiting For list
>- Reference material
>- A Someday/Maybe list
>
>It’s critical that all of these categories be kept pristinely distinct from one another.   
>The categories must be kept visually, physically, and psychologically separate, to promote clarity.
>
>**All You Really Need Are Lists and Folders**
>
> A list could look like one of at least three things: (1) a file folder or container with separate paper notes for the items within the category;
>(2) an actual list on a titled piece of paper (often within a loose-leaf organizer or planner); or (3) an inventory of items on a list in a software program or in a digital mobile device.
>
>For the purposes of organization, there are two basic kinds of actions:
>those that must be done on a certain day and/or at a particular time,
>and those that just need to be done as soon as you can get to them, around your other calendar items (some perhaps with a final due date).
>
>The real value of the Projects list lies in the complete review it can provide (at least once a week)
>
>the Weekly Review is the critical success factor for marrying your larger commitments to your day-to-day activities
>
>If gardening or sailing or cooking is your passion, you may need at least a whole file drawer for each of those designated hobbies.
>
>If material is purely for reference, the only issue is whether it’s worth the time and space to keep it.
>
>**your “work”** 
>1. Career goals
>2. Service
>3. Family
>4. Relationships
>5. Community
>6. Health and energy
>7. Financial resources
>8. Creative expression
>
>Be open to creating any kind of checklist as the urge strikes you. The possibilities are endless—from “Core Life Values” to “Things to Take Camping” to “Potential Holiday Gifts.”
>Making lists, ad hoc, as they occur to you, is one of the most powerful yet subtlest and simplest procedures that you can install in your life.  
>- Weekly Review (everything to review and/or update on a weekly basis)
>- People to Stay in Touch With (all the people you might want to connect with in your network)
>- Year-end Activities (all the actions for closing up for the time period)
>- Personal Development (things to evaluate regularly to ensure personal balance and progress)
>- etc.
>
>Get comfortable with checklists, both ad hoc and more permanent. Be ready to create and eliminate them as required.
>Make sure you have an easily accessed place to put a new list that’s also attractive and even fun to engage with—in a loose-leaf notebook or in a software application that is readily available.
>Appropriately used, checklists can be a tremendous asset in enhancing personal productivity and relieving mental pressure.


📧 **11:40** Received some work to do

🖱️ **13:55** Finished work but planned to submit it later

🖥️ **14:50** Tried to change CSS — but only changed background color to SHIRONERI `#FCFAF2` 😆  
😫 I also tried to change the color of the nav bar, but I couldn't get it to work...  

📖 **15:00** Continued reading *GTD*

📖 **17:15** Finished reading Chapter 7

📰 **17:25** Read [*The Jungian Model of the Psyche*](https://journalpsyche.org/jungian-model-psyche/?ref=DenseDiscovery-354)

>Jung believed that, not wanting to look at their Shadows directly, many people project them onto others, meaning that the qualities we often cannot stand in others, we have in ourselves and wish to not see.
>To truly grow as a person, one must cease such willful blindness to one’s Shadow and attempt to balance it with the Persona.
