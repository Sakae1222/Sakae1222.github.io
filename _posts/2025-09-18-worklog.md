💭 My boss is totally an idiot…

>**Notes:**
>
>Technology doesn’t follow culture so much as culture follows technology. New forms of expression naturally arise from new media, but so do new sensibilities and new behaviors.
>
>This is life now: one constant, never-ending stream of non sequiturs and self-referential garbage that passes in through our eyes and out of our brains at the speed of a touchscreen.
>
>When an online service is free, you’re not the customer. You’re the product.
>
>**every sliver of our attention is fair game for commercial exploitation**
>
>The past half century has been an age of unprecedented individualism, allowing us to live in all sorts of ways that were not possible before.
>The power we have been given to construct our attentional lives is an underappreciated example.
>Even while waiting for the dentist, we have the world at our finger tips: we can check mail, browse our favorite sites, play games, and watch movies, where once we had to content ourselves with a stack of old magazines.
>But with the new horizon of possibilities has also come the erosion of private life’s perimeter.
>And so it is a bit of a paradox that in having so thoroughly individualized our attentional lives we should wind up being less ourselves and more in thrall to our various media and devices.
>Without express consent, most of us have passively opened ourselves up to the commercial exploitation of our attention just about anywhere and anytime.
>If there is to be some scheme of zoning to stem this sprawl, it will need to be mostly an act of will on the part of the individual.
>
>Our life experience would ultimately amount to whatever we had paid attention to.

🪐 **13:55** Use [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) to find another option — [Bear Neo](https://github.com/rokcso/hugo-bearneo/?tab=readme-ov-file).

💢 **15:00** He’s really nasty, and I can’t concentrate on my work.  
🖕 My colleague sat behind me to listen to the boss’s nonsense, so I couldn’t read as much as I wanted.

🤔 After I turned on video autoplay on Reddit, I noticed I spent less time there, which made me feel better.
