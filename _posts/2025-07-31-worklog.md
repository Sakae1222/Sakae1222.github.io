## 0731 Morning at the office, afternoon at baseball game

I took paid leave for this afternoon — planning to go watch [a baseball game](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9&rlz=1C1PWSB_jaJP1106JP1109&oq=%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDggAEEUYORhGGP0BGIAEMgoIARAAGLEDGIAEMg0IAhAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgoIAxAAGLEDGIAEMgoIBBAAGLEDGIAEMgoIBRAAGLEDGIAEMgoIBhAAGLEDGIAEMg0IBxAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgcICBAAGIAEMgcICRAAGIAE0gEIMjY0MmowajGoAgiwAgHxBVYdP0XbbcaW8QVWHT9F223Glg&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11x0gzdkv8;4;/m/012xwy;dt;fp;1;;;) (first time watching a pro baseball game in Japan).

🚰 **9:00** Got a cup of water and slipped into chill mode

💭 **9:30** Might as well spend the morning learning to edit videos

✂️ Had a fight with my girlfriend, but still spent an hour learning the basics of Premiere Pro

📄 Read [an article about Jack Ma](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/06/07/the-sad-end-of-jack-ma-inc/?sh=55c1fd0c123a) — felt sick about the CCP again

🚾 Toilet break and adjusted AC from 22 to 24°C (I was freezing - even the water felt warm when I washed my hands😿

🌊 **11:20** Surfed the web, read some articles, and killed time until lunch
