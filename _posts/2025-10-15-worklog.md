## 1015 Restarted learning programming

👊 Today I will start learning JavaScript seriously.

🖥️ Started learning Chapter 2 once again — it was too difficult to understand.

🖥️ I spent a long time learning JavaScript, and because it’s the second time I’ve learned Chapter 2, I understood it better than before.

📓 **15:30** Wrote [Study Log #3](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/10/15/studylog.html)

📖 **16:50** Started reading *Four Thousand Weeks* Chapter 5 *The Watermelon Problem*

>**Notes:**

>What you pay attention to will define, for you, what reality is.

>But to describe attention as a ‘resource’ is to subtly misconstrue its centrality in our lives. Most other resources on which we rely as individuals – such as food, money and electricity – are things that facilitate life, and in some cases it’s possible to live without them, at least for a while. Attention, on the other hand, just is life: your experience of being alive consists of nothing other than the sum of everything to which you pay attention. At the end of your life, looking back, whatever compelled your attention from moment to moment is simply what your life will have been. So when you pay attention to something you don’t especially value, it’s not an exaggeration to say that you’re paying with your life.

>The job itself could be a distraction – that is, an investment of a portion of your attention, and therefore of your life, in something less meaningful than other options that might have been available to you.

😠 I hate myself for not being able to stop touching my face.
