## 1002 ITP Exercise Day and started read *Dubliners*

📝 I have to do more ITP exercises; there are only 10 days left! (○´･д･)ﾉ

💭 I don't know why I didn't greet my colleague. It wasn't like me, or maybe it was.

🖱️ **09:40** Made a brochure draft

🖥️ **10:10** Started doing ITP exercises

🖥️ **13:15** Kept doing exercise

☑️ **15:40** 37/50 — accuracy 74%

☑️ **17:30** 68/100 — 68%

📖 Actually, I started reading Dubliners but haven't finished the introduction.  
These days I haven’t kept reading *1984* on my Kindle. I’m interested in the story, so I will complete it this week.
