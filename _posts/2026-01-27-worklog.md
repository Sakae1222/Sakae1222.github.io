🏁 Made a list to note down information about major companies in Osaka

📘 This morning, I finished reading Matilda on the train to my workplace, which is the first English book I’ve read without a translator.

📖 **11:20** Started reading *Because of Winn-Dixie*

😴 Took a nap during lunch break

🙂 This afternoon, I’ll write blog posts and read books.

>You can’t hold on to anything. You can only love what you have while you have it.

🖥️ Learned a little bit of **SQL**

- `CREATE TABLE`: creates a new table.
- `INSERT INTO`: adds a new row to a table.
- `SELECT`: queries data from a table.
- `ALTER TABLE`: changes an existing table.
- `UPDATE`: edits a row in a table.
- `DELETE FROM`: deletes rows from a table.
