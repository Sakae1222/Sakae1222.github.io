## 0804 New week and new time to slack off

I had a hard weekend.  
Saturday morning, I did LSD training - a 14km run.    
Sunday morning, I went to keiko.  
Then went to IKEA with my girlfriend and bought some lovely interior accessories.  
After arriving home, we organized the room until 23:30. 

So I feel my muscles are so sore.  
I will take it easy today during work time, as usual, and stretch my legs under the desk all day.

🔄 **10:00** Moved photos from the server to USB — painfully slow network, absolute torture.

**Some episode:**  
At the same time,  my friend told me that she received the resume of a junior from my university, the one I hung out with last month.  
But it’s hard to give her an interview opportunity because she doesn’t have any experience.

I understand how that feels — I tried to change my career too, and I didn’t even get a chance.  
Then I asked how she managed to switch careers. She said she used a bunch of career services and just sent her resume out to lots of companies.

I thought about doing the same as she did, but I kept avoiding jobs I wasn’t interested in.  
So I never really moved forward. Maybe I should try doing the same this time… even if it’s not ideal.  

✂️ **11:00** Kept learning Adobe Premiere Pro

💰 **12:30** Went to the post office and got the cashback from Softbank

📖 **12:45** Read *The Psychology of Money*
> Volatility is the fee, not the fine. It’s the price of admission to long-term returns.

😪 **13:45** A little bit tired and feeling sleepy

🖇️ **14:30** Read some articles from [Owen's clip](https://clip.owenyoung.com/)

📘 **15:00** Finished making the new brochure

📑 **15:30** Started learning [English grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter06.html) (Chapter06)

😪 **16:00** Tried to stay awake

🏄‍♀️ **16:20** Found an interesting website called [*The Pudding*](https://pudding.cool/2025/06/hello-stranger/) through [Douchi's blog](https://blog.douchi.space/my-rss-setup/#gsc.tab=0) 

💭 Why do I get hungry so fast? It's still **16:30**!
