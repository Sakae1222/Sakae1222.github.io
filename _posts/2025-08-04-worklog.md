## 0804 New week and new time to slack off

I had a hard weekend.  
Saturday morning, I did LSD training - a 14km run.    
Sunday morning, I went to keiko.  
Then went to IKEA with my girlfriend and bought some lovely interior accessories.  
After arriving home, we organized the room until 23:30. 

So I feel my muscles are so sore.  
I will take it easy today during work time, as usual.

Moved photos from the server to USB — painfully slow network, absolute torture.

>**Some episode:**

>At the same time,  
>my friend told me that she received the resume of a junior from my university, the one I hung out with last month.  
>But it’s hard to give her an interview opportunity because she doesn’t have any experience.
>
>I understand how that feels — I tried to change my career too, and I didn’t even get a chance.  
>Then I asked how she managed to switch careers.  
>She said she used a bunch of career services and just sent her resume out to lots of companies.
>
>I thought about doing the same as she did, but I kept avoiding jobs I wasn’t interested in.  
>So I never really moved forward. Maybe I should try doing the same this time… even if it’s not ideal.  


Kept learning Adobe Premiere Pro
