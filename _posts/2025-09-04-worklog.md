🖥️ **09:20** With no emergency tasks today, I decided to study.

🖱️ **09:40** Got some work to do, a little bit urgent...

🔄 **10:15** Got it done and sent it to my colleague

📱 I forgot to bring my iPad mini 6, so I read an eBook on my phone during my lunch break.

💭 Actually, I received some flyer-fixing work to do before lunch break, but I wanted to continue studying CSS until I finished chapter 10.

🖥️ **14:05** Completed Chapter 10 and wrote [Study Log #8](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/09/04/studylog.html)

🖱️ **14:45** Worked on fixing the flyer

☑️ **15:55** Got things done — fixed the flyers, uploaded the data, placed an order with the printing company, and completed the payment

📖 **16:00** Started reading *The Attention Merchants* Part Ⅲ

>**Notes:**
>
>If email perhaps saved the Internet from a premature death, it also foretold its eventual significance.
>Its technical achievement would always remain the connection of different networks into one universal net.
>But its lasting importance to the individual would be the ability it conferred on him to connect with virtually anyone, whether for business, social reasons, or whatever else.
>As the content of those connections proved to be nothing less than astonishing in its potential variety, the Internet would begin devouring human attention.
>
>The check-in would eventually become a widespread attentional habit.
>
>Over the 1930s, a more famous scientist, B. F. Skinner, regarded free will to be an illusion and argued that our behavior is a fabric of responses to past stimuli, in particular the rewards or punishments that any behavior attracts.
>Understood this way, all animal behavior developed through a learning process he called “operant conditioning,” whereby some actions are reinforced by positive consequences (rewards), others discouraged by negative ones (punishments).

📖 **16:20** Started reading *So Good They Can't Ignore You* 

>**Notes:**
>
>Rule #4: Think small, act big (or, the importance of mission)
>
>To the general public, the idea that humans are still evolving can be surprising, but among evolutionary biologists it’s taken for granted.
>(One of the classic examples of recent human evolution is lactose tolerance—the ability to digest milk into adulthood—a trait that didn’t start spreading through the human population until we domesticated milk-producing animals.)🤯
>
>To have a mission is to have a unifying focus for your career.
>
>A good career mission is similar to a scientific breakthrough—it’s an innovation waiting to be discovered in the adjacent possible of your field.
>
>It’s a fool’s errand to try to figure out in advance what work will lead to this passion.
