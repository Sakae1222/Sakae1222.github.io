## 0905 Learning and reading

🌧️ It’s the day my friend is coming to Japan from Shanghai, but it’s a rainy day.  
💭 With my work done yesterday, I’ll spend the whole day studying today.  

🖥️ **09:20** Started learning CSS

🐤 Studying HTML and CSS is becoming more and more difficult, but also more and more enjoyable.  
🕛 I spent the whole morning studying it.  
🌞 And it’s become sunny, so I can ride my bike to keiko this evening.

📖 **13:10** Started read *So Good They Can't Ignore You* Chapter 15   
🥠 I think I can complete reading this book today.

>**Notes:**
>
>To construct work you love, you must first build career capital by mastering rare and valuable skills, and then cash in this capital for the type of traits that define compelling careers. Mission is one of those traits.
>
>You can’t skip straight into a great mission without first building mastery in your field.
>
>Mission is one of the most important traits you can acquire with your career capital.

📘 **14:15** Finished reading *So Good They Can't Ignore You* ☑️

📖 **16:30** Continued reading *The Attention Merchants* Part Ⅲ  
💭 Maybe I should drop this book, skim through part 4 quickly, and move on to the next one, because I don’t think I can gain any new knowledge from it anymore.

>**Notes:**
>
>The first great harvester of human attention, it must never be forgotten, was religion.
>
>The very expression “celebrity worship” may seem a figurative exaggeration; but insofar as intensity and duration of attention can separate devotion from other motivations, it would be hard to argue that what we have seen in our culture is anything less than an apotheosis.
>
>Celebrities were becoming attention merchants in their own right.

📘 **17:00** Finished reading Chapter 17

📱 I made a call to KIX to ask if a friend of my friend’s wallet was sent to the lost and found.  
🥹 But the answer was no, not yet. Oh god bless her.
