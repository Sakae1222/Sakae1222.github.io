## 0812 Recovery day

I had an exhausting weekend. Shopping and going to the Expo made me really tired.

Last week, I didn’t practice kendo at all and only ran once. It makes me feel kind of guilty.  
This week, I’ll do my best — at least three runs and two kendo practices. Even the weather looks bad.

Today's quote is 
>The sun also shines on the wicked. - Seneca
  
When I googled the meaning of this sentence, I found this [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/px4r7s/comment/hel2uav/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) comment: 

>Don't expect special consideration for doing the right thing.  

It's such a **truth**!

📖 **10:00** I found that there's nothing to do today as usual, so I started reading *Between Us* (Chapter 04).

>**Notes:**
>
>Rather than being merely an internal force that prods an individual, an emotion is a taking of a stance in a relationship.
>
>The majority of emotions take place in unfolding social interactions. What happens to my anger—the stance I initially take—is dependent on its reception. 

💭 Obon will start tomorrow. This year I still have no holiday.

🗞️ **14:00** Read [Dense Discovery – Issue 351](https://www.densediscovery.com/archive/)

>**Notes:**
>
>People have moved for many reasons, but always because they sought something they wanted that they could not get at home.

😓 Spent the whole day pretending to learn Adobe Premiere Pro

🙄 At least I read some good articles, such as this one about [migrants](https://archive.md/l8eU1).

>China’s people are incredibly talented, hard-working, and creative, and they deserve better than an aging Xi Jinping.  
> — [Xi JInping is the main thing holding China back](https://www.noahpinion.blog/p/xi-jinping-is-the-main-thing-holding)

💯 **17:20** The TOEIC score was released — I got [765](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SJWRfFpyZbRF8S7KCXAd0Dw2EkdZZbyr/view?usp=sharing)! My highest score ever.✨
