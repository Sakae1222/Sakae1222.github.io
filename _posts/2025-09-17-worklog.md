## 0917 Articles on Reminders, chose a new English name 

🖱️ Renamed the photos I made these days 

💭 The boss said he’s going to the Expo, so I guess he won’t come to the office today.   
📙 I’ll spend the day reading and start my second book on HTML5🚫.  
✍️ I realized that my English writing has improved a lot compared to last month, but it’s still not good enough. I can’t use difficult words yet.

>**Notes:**
>
>Someday/Maybe List: projects I might want to do, but not now . . . but I’d like to be reminded of them regularly.
>
>The item you’ll probably review most frequently is your **calendar**, which will remind you about the “hard landscape” for the day—that is, what things truly have to be handled that day.  
>After checking your calendar, you’ll most often turn to your **Next Action lists**. These hold the inventory of predefined actions that you can take if you have any discretionary time during the day.   
>**Projects, Waiting For, and Someday/Maybe lists** need to be reviewed only as often as you think they have to be in order to stop you from wondering about them.
>
>**Critical Success Factor: The Weekly Review**  
>Everything that might require action must be reviewed on a frequent enough basis to keep your mind from taking back the job of remembering and reminding.
>
>**The Weekly Review is the time to:**
>- Gather and process all your stuff.
>- Review your system.
>- Update your lists.
>- Get clean, clear, current, and complete.
>
>Every decision to act is an intuitive one. The challenge is to migrate from hoping it’s the right choice to trusting it’s the right choice.
>
>**The Four-Criteria Model for Choosing Actions in the Moment**: (in this order) context, time available, energy available, and priority.
>
>**The Threefold Model for Identifying Daily Work**:
>- Doing predefined work
>- Doing work as it shows up
>- Defining your work
>
>**The Six-Level Model for Reviewing Your Own Work**:
>- Horizon 5: Purpose and principles
>- Horizon 4: Vision
>- Horizon 3: Goals
>- Horizon 2: Areas of focus and accountabilities
>- Horizon 1: Current projects
>- Ground: Current actions
>
>Your mind goes through **five steps to accomplish virtually any task**:
>1. Defining purpose and principles
>2. Outcome visioning
>3. Brainstorming
>4. Organizing
>5. Identifying next actions
>
>How much of this planning model do you really need to flesh out, and to what degree of detail? The simple answer is, **as much as you need to get the project off your mind.**  
>In general, the reason things are on your mind is that the outcome and action step(s) have not been appropriately defined, and/or reminders of them have not been put in places where you can be trusted to look for them appropriately.
>Additionally, you may not have developed the details, perspectives, and solutions sufficiently to trust the efficacy of your blueprint.

>**Notes:**
>
>In retrospect, the first wave of bloggers and their fellow travelers can be likened to a first wave of visitors to some desert island, who erect crude, charming hostels and serve whatever customers come their way, and marvel at the paradise they’ve discovered.
>As in nature, so, too, on the web: the tourist traps high and low are soon to follow; commercial exploitation is on its way. Such, unfortunately, is the nature of things.

🖥️ **16:45** I used what I’ve learned these past few days to make a recruiting page [demo](https://sakae1222.github.io/practiceheadfirst/).

💡 I can use [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/zh_CN/download) to organize my ebooks.

### I decided on *Ray* as my new English name.
Why I chose Ray as my English name?
- The English name of the fish エイ is ray.
- The initial of Ray is the same as the first letter of my Chinese name.
- The spelling is simple and easy to remember.
- It’s a gender-neutral name.
