## 1230 The last workday of 2025

Today is the last workday of the year, even though many other companies started their holidays last weekend. 
I decided to start my own holiday yesterday, so today will be as chill as yesterday.

Yesterday, I wrote two blog posts to review my life over the past year. 
Today, I’ll finish reading _Charlotte’s Web_ and look for something else to do.

📖 **09:15** First of all, continued reading the book

📝 **10:35** Published new blog posts

📖 **13:18** Continued reading the book

📘 **13:50** Finished reading *Charlotte's Web*, my very first English book, without using a translator.

⌨️ **14:05** Updated my now page

😪 Had a very long meeting again, which made me feel really sleepy.

**Next year, I want to change my career — if I can find a job that offers a similar salary and lets me do more interesting work.**
