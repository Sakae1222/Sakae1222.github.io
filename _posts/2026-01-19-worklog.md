## 0119 Read books 

I will start changing my career today. 

I’ll also read books and write a blog post. 
Even though my current job is fucking boring, I can still find better ways to spend my time.

📖 **09:30** Started reading *Matilda* *Miss Honey*

🧠 I feel like I can’t calm down and just read a book, maybe because I’m sitting in the office.

📖 **11:22** Finally finished reading one chapter

🖥️ Learned how to debug in Chrome. Recently, I don’t really know where I’m going.

😪 Felt sleepy and couldn’t wake myself up

📖 **14:05** Started reading *Because of Winn-Dixie*

📖 **15:15** Started reading *Matilda* *The Trunchbull*

🖥️ Learned JavaScript [coding style](https://zh.javascript.info/coding-style)

📖 **15:55** Continued reading *The Parents* 

📖 And *Throwing the Hammer*

🧥 Actually, I didn’t want the yellow winter jacket, but I can leave the office 30 minutes early, so it’s not that bad.
