>**Notes:**
>
>We recoil from the notion that this is it – that this life, with all its flaws and inescapable vulnerabilities, its extreme brevity, and our limited influence over how it unfolds, is the only one we’ll get a shot at.
>
>The more you confront the facts of finitude instead – and work with them, rather than against them – the more productive, meaningful and joyful life becomes.


🙂 Nakata-sensei asked me if I wanted to participate in the adult kendo competition in November, and I said yes. Then I can practice kendo more seriously during the last four months of this year.
