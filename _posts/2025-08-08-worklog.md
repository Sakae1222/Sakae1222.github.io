## 0808 Low energy — afternoon off (PTO) 

This afternoon, I’ll take paid time off and attend a reunion with my classmates from my master’s program.  
So even though I’m a little tired, I just need to get through the morning. But having no work still drives me crazy.

>**Afternoon plan** — let’s make it clear:
>- 12:55 Arrive at Umeda
>- 13:00 Make up in the railway station bathroom
>- 13:15 Buy some fruits for professor
>- 13:25 Eat lunch 
>- 13:49 Take subway to Saito East
>- 15:00 The reunion - until 21:00 I guess
>- 22:00 Back home

💭 I must use this morning well!

💭 I think I can build my blog with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Here's a [tutorial article](https://www.gigigatgat.ca/posts/how-to-create-a-blog/) I’ll read first.  
🙆‍♀️ I’ve made a decision — I’ll build my blog this August. 

💭 Lately, I keep getting pimples. Why is this still happening at 27?

⏩ I really should begin learning [IT Passport](https://www3.jitec.ipa.go.jp/JitesCbt/index.html), perhaps this weekend.  
🏁 I’ll [sign up for the test](https://www3.jitec.ipa.go.jp/JitesCbt/html/application/applies.html) first, then get serious about learning.

😃 Found [Paul Graham's blog](https://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html) I read before where I can learn a lot  

>The articles I read before

>- [How to Do Great Work](https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html)
>- [How to Lose Time and Money ](https://www.paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html)

💭 Maybe I can talk about my career change with my professor and seniors...
