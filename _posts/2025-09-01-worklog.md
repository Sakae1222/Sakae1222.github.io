>Great tech oaks have always grown from little acorns.
>
>Consent is not always a simple matter, legally or philosophically. And willpower always figures into the complications.
>
>The successful philosophers were also advertisers who could sell their new models of the universe to large numbers of others, thus converting thought to action, mind to matter.
>
>Desire’s most natural endpoint is consumption.
>
>If you can hold the attention of children, you can educate them.
>
>As a mode of production, capitalism is a perfect chameleon; it has no disabling convictions but profit and so can cater to any desire, even those inimical to it.

📖 Started to read *So Good They Can't Ignore You* Chapter 1 & 2

>**Notes:**
>
>The conventional wisdom on career success—follow your passion—is seriously flawed.
>
>You need to be good at something before you can expect a good job.
>
>It’s good to enjoy what you do.
>
>I feel like your problem is that you’re trying to judge all things in the abstract before you do them. That’s your tragic mistake.
>
>Compelling careers often have complex origins that reject the simple idea that all you have to do is follow your passion.
>
>Conclusion #1: Career Passions Are Rare
>
>Conclusion #2: Passion Takes Time  
>A job, in Wrzesniewski’s formulation, is a way to pay the bills, a career is a path toward increasingly better work, and a calling is work that’s an important part of your life and a vital part of your identity.
>
>Conclusion #3: Passion Is a Side Effect of Mastery
>
>SDT(Self-Determination Theory) tells us that motivation, in the workplace or elsewhere, requires that you fulfill three basic psychological needs—factors described as the “nutriments” required to feel intrinsically motivated for your work:  
>1. Autonomy: the feeling that you have control over your day, and that your actions are important
>2. Competence: the feeling that you are good at what you do
>3. Relatedness: the feeling of connection to other people
>
>Working right trumps finding the right work.

💭 I think this book will help me change my perspective on my career.
