## 1224 Ate a lot of food bought by the boss and cleaned our office

☎️ I realized my junior colleague has started taking phone calls, so I feel relieved.

💭 There’s still no work for me to do, so I’ll change my career as soon as I can.

🍣 Ate a lot of food bought by the boss: sushi, roast beef, salad, and cake. Merry Christmas~

🏢 Cleaned the office with all my coworkers until **16:00**

I tried to complete the visitor visa application but failed.
