## 0820 Time flies — I want to be more efficient

These days, I’ve been reading books every day, which makes me feel comfortable. I guess I’ve found a better way to spend my time.  
Even though time goes by so fast, the knowledge I gain and the chapters I read help me grow.   
Also, the blogs I write help me remember what I did and what I want to do.  
Writing blogs is a good way to improve the quality of my life. I will keep writing my blog (this worklog) — if it can really be called a blog.

>**Notes:**
>
>Emotion vocabularies in some languages—such as Chewong in Malaysia—count as few as seven emotion words,
>and other languages count in the thousands, with English containing more than two thousand emotion words.
>There is no question, therefore, that languages organize the domain very differently, and make both different kinds as well as different numbers of distinctions.
>
>**Not all languages have words for emotion concepts**  
>The only term that came close to 100 percent was good (feeling good): almost all languages had a distinct word for it.
>The percentage of languages having a distinct word corresponding to the other English words was much lower: bad (as in feeling bad) occurred in 70 percent of the languages,
>love in less than one-third, happy and fear in about 20 percent, and anger and proud in less than 15 percent of the languages.
>
>if you learned a new language, especially a language from a different family than English (an Indo-European language),
>you would have much more trouble understanding the new emotion terms than you would have, say, understanding the color terms of that language.
>
>Some languages use the same word for pink and red, and some languages that fail to make the distinction between green and blue.
>
>You cannot assume you understand an emotion from another culture, just because there is a translation of the English emotion word.
>And if you did, you would risk projecting the English-language version of the emotion, rather than understanding the local emotion category represented by the word.
>
>The ways in which languages conceptualize emotions is different.
>
>The category of emotion itself is differently understood across cultures, but moreover, emotion lexicons from different languages do not neatly map.
>
>What an emotion concept comes to mean is largely dependent on common encounters within the culture, or on the encounters that receive attention.
>
>The way you make sense of your feelings depends on the emotion concepts that are available in your culture; these concepts are shared within your social community.
>
>There is good reason to assume that without a concept, there is no emotion as we know it.
>
>“Right” emotions are episodes with desired endings, “wrong” emotions are stories with endings that you would like to avoid.
>
>Finally, psychologist Lisa Feldman Barrett and her team have clearly shown that without a word available, it is also harder to perceive emotions in the face.
>Emotion lexicons organize our experiences; it is a fair hypothesis that culturally different lexicons constitute your emotional experience differently.
>
>Emotion concepts are sets of cultural episodes that we have experienced, directly or by observation, supplemented with the cultural lore of an emotion category.
>And to the extent that people’s emotion lexicons and experiences differ across cultures, so will the emotional experiences that they distinguish.
>This is not a radically constructionist view: cultures cannot invent people’s emotions from the ground up.
>This is because all our emotions are situated within relationships between people, who themselves are confined by the bodies that make them up.
>Human relationships and human bodies have a lot in common across cultures, but they also allow for much variation.
>
>If emotions do not refer to mental states, but rather to stories in the world, then our emotions differ because the worlds in which we live differ.
>That we can talk about emotions across cultures is owing to the fact that some things are stable:
>people in all cultures have emotions about other people they care about, challenges of their social position, the success of their group, and about what they consider to be good, beautiful, and moral.

😫 **16:40** Finished reading Chapter 6 finally

😠 This afternoon, my boss was angry and shouted loudly again, which made me feel awful and made me want to change my job again.

📗 **17:10** Studied English grammar [Chapter 13](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter13.html)

🏄‍♀️ Spent the rest of today reading blogs~~~
