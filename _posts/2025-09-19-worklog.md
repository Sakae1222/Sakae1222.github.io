**Today marks the 2nd anniversary of my partner and me.🎉**

🖋️ So I want to write a blog post about my partner.

💭 I wonder if my colleagues actually have work. Why do they look so busy every day?

📝 **10:00** Wrote blog post in memo. I like plain text.

⏺️ I’m going to use [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/chinese/learn) to practice coding.

🤩 **An exciting discovery** — the [blogs](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) of people who use Bear! ╰(⋆°▽°⋆)╯

🖼️ Used DALL-E to create a picture, then edited it with Photoshop — kind of good
