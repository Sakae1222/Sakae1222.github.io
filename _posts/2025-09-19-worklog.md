## 0919 Wrote, read, and added a comment system

🎉 **Today marks the 2nd anniversary of my partner and me.**

🖋️ So I want to write a blog post about my partner.

💭 I wonder if my colleagues actually have work. Why do they look so busy every day?

📝 **10:00** Wrote blog post in memo. I like plain text.

⏺️ I’m going to use [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/chinese/learn) to practice coding.

🤩 **An exciting discovery** — the [blogs](https://bearblog.dev/discover/) of people who use Bear! ╰(⋆°▽°⋆)╯

🖼️ Used DALL-E to create a picture, then edited it with Photoshop — kind of good

🌼 **15:30** Finished writing the blog post [about my partner](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/09/19/thinking.html)

🖥️ **16:40** After reading this [comment](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/chadbaldwin.github.io/issues/11#issuecomment-898099648), I added a comment system to my blog by [utterances](https://github.com/apps/utterances) — and yes, it worked!

📖 **17:20** Continued reading *GTD*

>Setting Aside the Time  
>Setting Up the Space — You must have a dedicated, individual, self-contained workspace—at home, at work, and even in transit.  
>Getting the Tools You’ll Need

>all you really need to do is manage lists. You’ve got to be able to create a list on the run and review it easily and as regularly as you need to.

>Label Your File — **Things you name, you own. Collected but unnamed stuff owns you.**

>Wherever items of different character or meaning are piled into the same location, it’s too much work to continually think about the nature of the contents, so your brain will go numb to the pile.

💭 Reading this book really gave me some inspiration — now I know how to practice decluttering — I can file my stuff and check if it’s worth keeping.
