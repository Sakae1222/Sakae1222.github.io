## 0826 Another boring day but thinking and learning

📔 **09:30** I collected all the excerpts from Between Us and stored them in a text document.

🖊️ **10:30** Wrote a blog post [about reading](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/08/26/thinking.html) 

💭 I found that AI can generate perfect reading notes, but I can’t write as well. How should I learn?  
😅 And ChatGPT gave me some advice:  

```
至于“如何学习写读书笔记”，我给你分三步：

1. 模仿 + 简化  
先不用追求“完美”，而是挑选一篇 AI 生成的读书笔记，模仿它的结构。  
比如：  
- Summary（概要）：一句话总结。  
- Key Points（重点）：3–5条。  
- My Thoughts（感想）：自由写。  
一开始每个部分写一句话就够了，不要怕短。

2. 输入转化输出  
读的时候，在书页或电子书里做关键词标记（不需要写完整句子）。
然后在写笔记时，把关键词扩展成简短句子。
这样不会觉得太难，而且慢慢能形成自己的表达。

3. 渐进练习
Level 1：抄录/翻译书中句子。
Level 2：用自己的话改写。
Level 3：写一句自己的思考。
每次只要比上一次多加一句自己的想法，你的笔记就会越来越像“你自己的作品”。

其实你已经在用英语写日记了，这本身就是很好的练习。写读书笔记和写日记类似，只是多了“结构”。

>**Notes:**
>
>I never met a person who looked down on others and unconditionally accepted themselves.
>For people who are self-accepting, it is usually less the case that some people are treated like they are golden and others like they are cursed.
>They may still have preferences to engage with some people over others, but their baseline patience and goodwill does not fall and rise intensely.
>
>Not desire, not need, love — to see them wholly, with gentleness and acceptance.
>If you are able to do that, most people will sense it. And they will try to love you back.


🤔 I found that since I stopped the air conditioner’s automatic swing, I don’t feel cold anymore even when I’m only wearing a T-shirt.

😪 **13:40** Still felt so sleepy

📗 **14:00** Woke up and started learning Engslish grammar

📝 **14:30** Calculated my points and found I have to pass the [exams](https://www.ipa.go.jp/shiken/mousikomi/cbt_sg_fe.html) ([FE](https://www.ipa.go.jp/shiken/kubun/fe.html) & [SG](https://www.ipa.go.jp/shiken/kubun/sg.html)) as quickly as possible.

📗 **15:00** Finished [Chapter 15](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter15.html) and started studying [Chapter 16](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter16.html)

>**Notes:**

|五种简单句|结构|缩写含义|
|---|---|---|
|1. S+V|主语 + 动词	|
|2. S+V+O|主语 + 动词 + 宾语|S：主语|
|3. S+V+C|主语 + 动词 + 补语|V：动词|
|4. S+V+O+O|主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + 宾语|O：宾语|
|5. S+V+O+C|	主语 + 动词 + 宾语 + 补语|	C：补语|

>如果说简单句是初级句型，复句、合句是中级句型，那么精简的简化从句就是高级句型。
>
>复句的简化包括名词从句、形容词从句、副词从句三种的简化。
>一般语法书称这三种从属从句的简化为“非限定从句”（Nonfinite Clauses），并称其中的 Ving（动名词或现在分词）、Ven（过去分词）与 to V（不定词）为“非限定动词”（Nonfmite Verbs）
>
>不论是名词类、形容词类还是副词类的从属从句，简化的共同原则是省略主语与 be 动词，只保留补语部分。
>
>所有的语气助动词都可以改写成 be 动词加不定词

📗**15:30** Finished Chapter16

📎**15:50** Reorganized my tags by: `Work` `English` `Reading` `Programming` `Thinking`  
💭 When I organize my Obsidian notes these tags will be helpful.

💡 I realized that when I write `tags`, the words are automatically split into two or more tags.   
💡 But when I write `tag`, the words are treated as a single tag.

📖 **16:00** Started to read *The Attention Merchants* Part Ⅱ Chapter 7 & 8

>**Notes:**
>
>The invention of “Prime time” — the attentional habit of turning on the radio (later, the television) at the designated hour each and every evening of the year —
>was a momentous cultural as well as commercial innovation at a point when the two categories were drifting steadily closer.
>For it transformed not only the industries equipped to capture attention, but also the lives of those whose attention was now there for the taking.
>We have already remarked how who we are can be defined, at least in part, by what we attend to—how much more so this is when what we attend to is determined less by our volition and more by ambience.
>
>Our most immediate environment is actually formed by what holds our attention from moment to moment, whether having received or taken it.
>As William James once put it, “My experience is what I agree to attend to.”
>
>The attention merchants would rely on the power of entertainment to weld audiences into a saleable product.
>
>The attention merchant’s business model was always a bit sinister and easily misunderstood.
