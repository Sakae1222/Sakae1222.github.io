## 1006 Another IT Passport exercise day

💭 Today I’ll still try to do as many ITP exercises as I can.

🖥️ **10:10** Received some work from my boss. And decided to do it very slowly while doing ITP exercises.

|14:25|29/40|72.5%|
|16:10|34/50|68.0%|
|16:50|41/60|68.3%|
|17:05|49/70|70.0%|
|17:20|55/80|58.8%|
|17:30|62/90|68.9%|

😪 Feel very sleepy until **13:30**

**15:45** Wrote [a thinking log](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/10/06/thinking.html) about yesterday’s kendo match.

>*Four Thousand Weeks*

>**Notes:**
>
>The invention of the clock is solely to blame for all our time-related troubles today. (And I certainly won’t be arguing for a return to the lifestyle of medieval peasants.)
>But a threshold had been crossed. Before, time was just the medium in which life unfolded, the stuff that life was made of.
>Afterwards, once ‘time’ and ‘life’ had been separated in most people’s minds, time became a thing that you used – and it’s this shift that serves as the precondition for all the uniquely modern ways in which we struggle with time today.
>
>Once time is a resource to be used, you start to feel pressure, whether from external forces or from yourself, to use it well, and to berate yourself when you feel you’ve wasted it.
>
>And it becomes a lot more intuitive to project your thoughts about your life into an imagined future, leaving you anxiously wondering if things will unfold as you want them to.
>Soon, your sense of self-worth gets completely bound up with how you’re using time:
>it stops being merely the water in which you swim and turns into something you feel you need to dominate or control, if you’re to avoid feeling guilty, panicked or overwhelmed.
>
>The trouble with attempting to master your time, it turns out, is that time ends up mastering you.
