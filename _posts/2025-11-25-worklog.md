## 1125 A cold rainy day

I will restart my job search after listing all the companies in Osaka that I’m interested in.
Especially after these days of fieldwork in Nara, I believe I won’t still be doing this nonsense job at this time next year.
My flight got cancelled last week, which made me think that maybe I should consider changing my nationality instead of getting PR first.
