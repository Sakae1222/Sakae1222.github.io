## 1104 Winter is coming

Today I went to Nara to start my day job and got back to the head office around 2 p.m. 
It was cold, but I still felt grateful to have some quiet time to myself, without doing real work or thinking about anything.

Before writing my work log, I found that I can also write my main blog on GitHub, just like I do with my work log.

🖥️ **14:40** Remade the company logo

📝 **14:55** Started working on my new blog

🖥️ **15:50** Tried to add a “Not by AI” [badge](https://notbyai.fyi/help/#how-to) to my blog, but couldn’t get it to work
