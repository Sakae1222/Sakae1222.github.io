## 1105 Worked hard before lunch and slacked off the whole afternoon

🖱️ I spent the morning duplicating an existing business card. It’s been a long time since I last worked straight through without slacking for even a second before lunch.

🤔 It made me feel tired, so I decided to do something else instead of pushing myself to keep working.

☎️ Today I took some important calls—not sales calls, real ones—which made me kind of happy.
