## 1201 Started wearing my down jacket — Noverber summary

🖱️ **10:00** Got some work, but decided to do it in the afternoon

Today, I started wearing my down jacket. Every time I wear one, I always think of my hometown, where I had to wear down jackets and much warmer clothes.
It’s December, and I’ll go back to my hometown this month and return to Japan next month. But I’m worried about whether the plane will fly as scheduled.

I adjusted my exercise plan and added swim and gym session each week.

**Monday:** 🌙 30 minutes of weightlifting + 30 minutes of swimming  
**Tuesday:** ☀️ Run (5-10 km)  
**Wednesday:** 🌙 Swimming lesson (regular)  
**Thursday:** ☀️ Run (5-10 km), 🌙 30 minutes of weightlifting + 30 minutes of swimming  
**Friday:** (Rest) or 🌙 Kendo (Optional)  
**Saturday:** ☀️ Run (5-10 km), **🌙 Kendo**  
**Sunday:** **☀️ Kendo**, Afternoon Rest

📖 **16:00** Started reading *刻意练习*

🖱️ **17:20** Finished the work and roughly wrote my November summary

### November summary

**Things**
- Attended the Kendo competition for working adults.
- Attended the annual meeting of the organization that received the scholarship during my graduate school years.
- Had lunch with my colleagues twice (rice balls and spicy hot pot).
- Attended the keiko session led by 栄花英幸範士.
- The protective gear I bought in 2018 has a hole worn through in the wrist.

- Flights back to Japan were cancelled

**Sports**
- I haven't run at all since returning from the Yokohama Marathon. I've been almost always on time for kendo this month, so I've given myself a long break from running. I've reset my finish time goal on my watch and plan to resume training in December.
- But I participated in 12 kendo keiko sessions.

**Book**
- I only finished reading two books because I spent most of my free time decorating my blog and writing random things, so I had much less time to read than last month.
  - How to Become an Imperfectionist
  - コンビニ人間
  
- I'm currently reading
  - *One Hundred Years of Solitude*
  - *Deliberate Practice*
  - *Hackers & Painters*  
  (I read it while slacking off at work, on my Kindle, and on my phone during spare moments.)
