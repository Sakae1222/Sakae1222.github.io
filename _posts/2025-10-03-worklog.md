## 1003 A tough day — something's wrong with my body

💩 It was a tough morning — I had to get off at Nishinomiya because of a bad stomachache… and ended up pooping in the station toilet. I’m glad it didn’t make me late for work…

💡 Today I want to do ITP exercises just like yesterday and keep reading *Dubliners*. I actually finished the first story yesterday — it was short and easy to read, so maybe I can read more today.

🔍 Found a [website](https://wa3.i-3-i.info/index.html) that explains IT terms in simple, understandable words.

😢 I can't stop touching my face - I'm such a fool.

💬 I chatted with Gemini, ChatGPT, and Kimi about my stomach trouble. 
Gemini advised me to go to the hospital as soon as possible, while the other two suggested changing my diet and lifestyle first to see if that helps. I’d like to give that a try.

😢 I’m scared that something is wrong with my body, and my partner didn’t respond to my texts all morning, which makes me feel a little sad.

🙀 **14:50** She still hasn’t responded to me yet. What happened?

📖 **16:00** I kept reading *Dubliners* and realized it would be better to read a translated version than to keep using a translator for the original.

📖 **16:15** After downloading the Chinese version, I started reading another book — *Four Thousand Weeks* by Oliver Burkeman

>**Notes:**
>
>In the modern world, the American anthropologist Edward T. Hall once pointed out, time feels like an unstoppable conveyor belt, bringing us new tasks as fast as we can dispatch the old ones; and becoming ‘more productive’ just seems to cause the belt to speed up.
>
>Productivity is a trap. Becoming more efficient just makes you more rushed, and trying to clear the decks simply makes them fill up again faster.
