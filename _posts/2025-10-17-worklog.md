🔍 Did some research on how to adjust my diet before next Sunday, the marathon day — seems like I have to eat more rice than usual.

⌚ Next Sunday is not only my race day but also my girlfriend’s, but she hasn’t run more than 5 km yet. I’m kind of worried about her, but I still believe she can do it, since the time limit is long enough — I guess.

💭 The new person sitting beside me makes me unable to calm down and do what I really want to do, so I just keep writing in English, which Japanese people aren’t usually good at, to make it look like I’m doing something important.

💡 I realized that today is already Friday, and I haven’t finished my summary from last week. I want to do it during work hours today.

📖 **10:15** Looks like the rookie girl is very sleepy, so I decided to start reading *Four Thousand Weeks* Part Ⅱ *Beyond Control* Chapter 7 *We Never Really Have Time*

>**Notes:**
>
>The obsessive planner, essentially, is demanding certain reassurances from the future – but the future isn’t the sort of thing that can ever provide the reassurance he craves, for the obvious reason that it’s still in the future.
>
> You only ever get to feel certain about the future once it’s already turned into the past.
>
>The assumption that time is something we can possess or control is the unspoken premise of almost all our thinking about the future, our planning and goal-setting and worrying.
>So it’s a constant source of anxiety and agitation, because our expectations are forever running up against the stubborn reality that time isn’t in our possession and can’t be brought under our control.
>
>Despite our total lack of control over any of these occurrences, each of us made it through to this point in our lives – so it might at least be worth entertaining the possibility that when the uncontrollable future arrives, we’ll have what it takes to weather that as well.
>And that you shouldn’t necessarily even want such control, given how much of what you value in life only ever came to pass thanks to circumstances you never chose.
>
>We treat our plans as though they are a lasso, thrown from the present around the future, in order to bring it under our command. But all a plan is – all it could ever possibly be – is a present-moment statement of intent.
>It’s an expression of your current thoughts about how you’d ideally like to deploy your modest influence over the future. The future, of course, is under no obligation to comply.
