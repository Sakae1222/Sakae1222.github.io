## 1118  Just another cold day

When I arrived in Nara this morning, I noticed that the leaves had turned even redder. 
While we were doing the same job as last week, the sunlight kept us warm, but the wind was really cold. 
And when we took turns guarding, the sun hid behind the clouds and the wind got even colder, which made me really uncomfortable.

It was so cold that a shirt wasn’t enough to block the wind. We tried to get a coat, but there wasn’t a spare one. 
Still, I was grateful that when we got back to the head office, my senior colleague gave me her coat.
