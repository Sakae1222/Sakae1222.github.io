## 0902 Head First HTML and CSS — Study Log #6

#### Chapter 7. *Getting Started with CSS: Adding a Little Style*

- CSS contains simple statements, called rules.
- A typical rule consists of a `selector(选择器)` along with one or more `properties(属性)` and `values(值)`.
- Each property declaration ends with a `;` (semicolon).
- All properties and values in a rule go between `{ }` (braces).
- By separating `element` names with `,` (commas), you can select multiple `elements` at once.
- Use `.classname` to select any `elements` that belong to the `class`.
- You can specify that an element belongs to more than one class by placing multiple class names in the class attribute with spaces between the names.

- Not every style is inherited. Just some are, like `font-family`.
- The `<a>` and `<em>` elements inherited the `font-family` style from the `<p>` element, which is their **parent element**.
- To write a comment in your CSS, just enclose it between `/*` and `*/`.
  - e.g. `/* this rule selects all paragraphs and colors them blue */`
- Use the `class` attribute to add `elements` to a class. `Elements` can be in **more than one** `class`.
