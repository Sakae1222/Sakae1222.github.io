## 0901 Head First HTML and CSS — Study Log #5

#### Chapter 6. *Standards and All that Jazz: Getting Serious with HTML*

- To specify Unicode for your web pages, you’ll need a `<meta>` tag in your HTML
- The `<meta>` tag belongs in the `<head>` element (remember that the `<head>` contains information about your page).
- The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the standards organization that defines what standard HTML is.
  - The [W3C validator](http://validator.w3.org) is a free online service that checks pages for compliance with standards.
- Always begin with the `<doctype>`. The document type definition (doctype) is used to tell the browser the version of HTML you’re using.
- Include a `<meta charset="utf-8">` tag in your `<head>`. The `charset` attribute of the `<meta>` tag tells the browser the character encoding that is used for the web page.
- Always give your `<head>` element a `<title>` element. The `<head>` element is the only place you should put your `<title>`, `<meta>`, and `<style>` elements.
- The `alt` attribute is required for the `<img>` element.

```

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Head First Lounge</title>
  </head>
  <body>
   ...
  </body>
</html>

```
