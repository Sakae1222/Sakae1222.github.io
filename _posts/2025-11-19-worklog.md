It’s November 19th! Time flies so fast. Next month, on this day, I’ll take a flight back to China. 
It’s so exciting — the last time I went back was in the summer of 2023, and two and a half years have passed.

My domain can’t be accessed just because I didn’t send my driver’s license to the service center.
It’s so foolish. I’ll switch to Cloudflare as soon as I can.

I decided to take a paid day off on December 19th so I can go to the airport earlier and make sure the tax-free procedures are done in time.]
