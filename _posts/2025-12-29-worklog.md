## 1229 May I Have a Vacation? — December Summary

It was a little scary when I arrived at the head office and there was nobody there. I even wondered if today was a holiday. 
But after I came out of the restroom, I saw someone, which made me feel better.

Today is a workday, but many companies started their holidays last Saturday, unlike us. 
So I decided to give myself a “vacation” — sitting in the office but doing my own stuff on the computer, just like I’ve often done this year.

First of all, I’ll write a simple review of my December. Then I’ll finish reading my book. 
I didn’t read enough books this month, but if I can finish this one, that will be good enough. 
After all, this is my first book written in English, and I didn’t rely on a translator the whole time.

📝 **10:40** Wrote last week’s kendo diary 

📖 **13:20** Finished reading Chapter 16

📝 **14:30** Wrote an annual review of the books I read this year and the dramas I watched

💭 There are only five people left now; the others have started their vacations. It makes me feel free and comfortable, since there’s only one senior colleague here.

📝 **17:18** Wrote the annual review of exercises
