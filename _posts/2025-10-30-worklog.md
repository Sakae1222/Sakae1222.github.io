## 1030 From Nara to Kobe

I got up at 5:20 and went to Nara to start my day job. 
I was responsible for giving courtroom observers wristbands printed with their randomly assigned numbers. 
The place was very close to Nara Park, so there were lots of deer — I even touched one during break time. 
After finishing work, my coworker and I took the train back to Kobe. I also heard that I could go home at 4 p.m., which was kind of good news.

After handing out the wristbands, I got a break and then stood guard for fifteen minutes—just telling people not to go that way. 
During those fifteen minutes, I felt calm; it was a peaceful moment: the deer were cute, the weather was perfect, and the view was beautiful.
I think I should create more moments like this in my future life. They make me feel alive and let me deeply sense how beautiful life is.

After leaving the place we were guarding, we passed in front of the courthouse. 
There were so many people — police officers, security guards, journalists, and visitors. 
My coworkers walked so fast, but my leg muscles are still a bit sore, so I couldn’t walk as fast as I wanted and almost couldn’t catch up with them.

On the train back to Kobe I fell asleep. It’s the second time this week I’ve been up so early; I need more sleep and rest.
