## 0814 I should continue learning programming

### [Should you learn programming? Yes.](https://sive.rs/prog)

>**To-do list:**
>- [x] Read books
>- [x] Learn CSS
>- [x] Study [English grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter09.html)
>- [x] Make plans for the last half of August

📖 **9:30** Started reading *Between Us*
>**Notes:**  
>In Buddhist psychology anger (that I do not get what I want) is a poison in human nature—as despicable as the illusion that I am entitled to get what I want and that the world ought to give it to me (from which anger springs).
>
>When circumstances frustrate the ideal, U.S. Americans find blame and unfairness, whereas Japanese are more reflective of their own shortcomings, and try to overcome difficulties.
>Anger as nonacceptance is woven into a general view on life.
>
>Humiliated fury appears to skip the painful experience of rejection and transforms it into aggression towards others.
>One way of understanding the benefits of humiliated fury is that ashamed individuals draw on anger as a resource to overcome the painful and paralyzing experience of shame, and to regain agency and control, though sometimes at a great cost to themselves and others.
>
>Emotions are prevalent when they are right and rare when they are wrong.

📷 **11:00** Deleted over 100 photos

🖥️ **11:30** Finished Chapter 4 and started [learning CSS](https://www.runoob.com/css/css-text.html)

💭 My boss makes me feel awful.   
💢 I don’t know what he was thinking… Poster design is exactly my area, but he gave the details to my colleague, who can’t really design.

✔️ **13:30** Updated the recruiting brochure with new content

💯 **14:10** Registered for the IT Passport test on [Oct. 12th](https://calendar.app.google/3FuTuJaLoztQg9VVA)  
📗 There are two reference books on [Z-Library](https://1lib.sk/s/IT%E3%80%80%E3%83%91%E3%82%B9%E3%83%9D%E3%83%BC%E3%83%88?).  
🗂️ Found the books in [my Google Drive library](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19cYvsesxL8uWKUyWutgW8cSnY4wj0c5g?usp=sharing)

💭 If I have time, I should read this book — [*Computer Networks From Scratch*](https://www.networksfromscratch.com/1.html), to learn more about computers.

😪 Drowsy until **15:40**  
❓ When I finally woke up, my boss was talking to my colleague about the plot of *Kimetsu no Yaiba*… It was interesting, but WHY?

🤩 Found the Korean textbook whose name I had forgotten! — 『本気で学ぶ韓国語』

💭 I believe this is why I note everything down — [Benefits of a daily diary and topic journals](https://sive.rs/dj).  

👩‍💼 Another wonderful article by Derek Sivers — [How to change or build your career](https://sive.rs/career)

📗 **17:50** Finally finished my grammar study
