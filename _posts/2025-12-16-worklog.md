## 1216 Health check, asked for employment certificate

I had my second health check of the year this morning. After that, I got back to the head office and started slacking off.

🤮 Around **14:15**, I took the most uncomfortable phone call ever, which made me feel terrible. I want to escape from this company as soon as possible.

😫 **15:05** I still haven’t asked the woman who can issue my employment certificate. I asked ChatGPT and decided to wait until she stops typing before asking.

>Stronger values make you spend more mindfully because they shift the axis of desire.
>When you know what you worship—what you actually stand for and who you want to become—everything gets tested against that vision.
>Values act like a sieve: they filter out the empty cravings that come from comparison and they let through only the things that genuinely serve your spirit.
>Without values, desires lead you astray by following ads and algorithms and the envy of friends—a state commonly known as “being distracted”.
