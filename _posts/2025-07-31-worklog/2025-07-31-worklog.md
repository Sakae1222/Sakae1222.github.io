## 0731 Morning at the office, afternoon at baseball game

I took paid leave for this afternoon ‚Äî planning to go watch [a baseball game](https://www.google.com/search?q=%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9&rlz=1C1PWSB_jaJP1106JP1109&oq=%E3%82%AA%E3%83%AA%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyDggAEEUYORhGGP0BGIAEMgoIARAAGLEDGIAEMg0IAhAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgoIAxAAGLEDGIAEMgoIBBAAGLEDGIAEMgoIBRAAGLEDGIAEMgoIBhAAGLEDGIAEMg0IBxAAGIMBGLEDGIAEMgcICBAAGIAEMgcICRAAGIAE0gEIMjY0MmowajGoAgiwAgHxBVYdP0XbbcaW8QVWHT9F223Glg&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#sie=m;/g/11x0gzdkv8;4;/m/012xwy;dt;fp;1;;;) (first time watching a pro baseball game in Japan).

üö∞ **9:00** Got a cup of water and slipped into chill mode

üí≠ **9:30** Might as well spend the morning learning to edit videos

‚úÇÔ∏è Had a fight with my girlfriend, but still spent an hour learning the basics of Premiere Pro

üìÑ Read [an article about Jack Ma](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/06/07/the-sad-end-of-jack-ma-inc/?sh=55c1fd0c123a) ‚Äî felt sick about the CCP again

üîó Found another useful link where you can [search for words and find real usage examples in YouTube videos](https://youglish.com/). Thanks [Owen](https://www.owenyoung.com/english-learning/)!

üåä **11:20** Surfed the web, read some articles, and killed time until lunch
