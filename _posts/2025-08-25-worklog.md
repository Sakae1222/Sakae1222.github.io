## 0825 Kind of a boring morning, planning to study all day

Looks like another quiet day at work — I want to learn programming, practice English, and read some books and articles.

🦟 I got bitten by a mosquito on the back of my ankle the day before yesterday, and it's unbearably itchy.

📖 First at all, read *The Attention Merchants* Chapter 5&6

>**Notes:**
>
>**Information cannot be acted upon without attention and thus attention capture and information are essential to a functioning market economy**, or indeed any competitive process, like an election (unknown candidates do not win).
>So as a technology for gaining access to the human mind, advertising can therefore serve a vital function, making markets, elections, and everything that depends on informed choice operate better,
>by telling us what we need to know about our choices, ideally in an objective fashion.
>
>For the advertisers, by far the most valuable function of advertising, then, is the shaping or creation of demands that would not otherwise exist.
>
>The most effective brand advertising, after all, does not try to convince you to make a choice, but rather to convince you that there is no choice.

📖 **11:40** Finished reading Part Ⅰ

🖥️ Started learning HTML and CSS and wrote [Study Log #2](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/08/25/studylog.html)  
💭 Since I wrote a study log, I will write my thinking log tomorrow.

🖥️ **15:30** Finished learning Chapter 3  
👍 What a nice textbook! I will recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn HTML and CSS.

📰 Read some articles

🤮 Boss shouted again. Why is he always so angry?

📖 **17:10** I was so bored, so I started reading *Between Us* Chapter 8

>**Notes:**
>
>We cannot understand the emotions of others unless we try to adopt their frame of reference.  
>We can only understand their emotions when we understand them as OURS—following them OUtside, rather than INside.
>
>Understanding the emotions of others is not merely a matter of intellectual curiosity.
>Emotions make you part of your group or culture, and unfortunately, the opposite can be true, too.
>
>Mere empathy does not work, because it does not overcome the cultural gap.
>
>No two people have experienced the very same episodes in their lives, and even if we speak the same language and share the same emotional concepts, our unique experiences may have colored those concepts differently.
>
>Do not assume that a person who does not behave the way you expect is suppressing their authentic, real emotion. Ask. Don’t assume how the episode is ending, and is supposed to end.
>
>When unpacking the emotional episodes, it is important to try to understand the dance that is being performed: the interpersonal goals.
>
>Humility vis-à-vis another person’s emotions may always be a good idea—we all come from different places, have different experiences, and have unique goals—but it is particularly advisable when you are not part of the OURS of another person’s emotions.
>Yes, emotions differ across cultures in many different ways. At the same time, it is possible to relate to other people’s emotions once you meet them on their terms, once you humanize them.
>
>We are partners in it together—emotional episodes are accomplished Between Us.

🤮 My boss is really noisy.
