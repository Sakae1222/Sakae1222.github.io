## 1127 It’s time to stop being hard on myself

📱 Did a search for a habit-tracker app

🖱️ Did some work

🌲 **10:50** I found an app that seems to meet all my needs well — [Habitdone](https://habitdone.app/zh). 

🪙 The app looks really good to use, so I’ll pay for one month (100 yen) to try the Pro version.

>“Meet all my needs” means the app can do everything you want it to do — it satisfies all your requirements.

📖 **11:00** Started reading *刻意练习* while doing work

🍊 **14:00** Ate an orange and searched where it's from, then found a website about [oranges](https://www.ito-noen.com/dictionary/mikan)

🪴 Helped take care of the dead plant in front of the office

❓ It’s so weird. If the new guy is going to make this year’s pamphlet, what should I do?

💭 I don’t want to stay here anymore. After I get back to Japan, I will seriously look for a new position.

🖥️ **16:40** Started learning [JavaScript](https://zh.javascript.info/alert-prompt-confirm)

📖 **17:23** Restarted reading the book
