## 0805 Thinking, learning and slacking off

>When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn't have to look outside themselves for approval.  
>--Epictetus

✍️ Tried writing [blog post in Chinese](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter07.html); worked on it until **10:40**  
💭 I think I love the feeling of thinking and writing.

📗 Continued learning [English grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter07.html) (Chapter 07)
    
>### **Notes**: 
>英语的修饰语有两种词类：形容词和副词。  
>   
>alike 和 alone 是 a- 开头的古英语形容词  
>古英语 a- 的词首代表一种暂时性的状态，所以这两个词除了可以放在补语位置外，如要用在名词短语中，只能放在名词后面。  
>- John and his brother alike are unreliable. （约翰和他弟弟都不可靠。）  
>- Money alone cannot solve our problem.（光靠钱解决不了我们的问题。）  

🎯 Found the best way to **read English books** — 
1. Use [1Paragraph](https://1paragraph.app/)
2. Translate English to Chinese with [Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/zh-Hans/)
3. Generate a PDF (or convert to EPUB)
4. Read it on iPad or iPhone

📰 **14:30** Browsed Hacker News for a while on [*Buzzing*](https://www.buzzing.cc/)

😅 **15:00** Finally did some work — updated the expo recruiting brochure

📖 **15:30** Read *Between Us* — Chapter 1: Lost in Translation

>### **Notes**:  
>I believed that, deep down, all people would turn out to have emotions just like mine. I no longer do.  
>我相信，在内心深处，所有人都会有和我一样的情绪。我不再这样做了。
>
>Any community that provides a set of experiences, understandings of the world, relationship practices,   
>moral sensitivities, and values and goals may shape the emotions we have as individuals.   
>Different cohorts, different socioeconomic groups, different religions, different gender cultures,   
>and even different family cultures may provide emotions with their meaning.  
>任何提供一系列经验、对世界的理解、关系实践、道德敏感性以及价值观和目标的社区都可能塑造我们作为个人的情感。  
>不同的群体、不同的社会经济群体、不同的宗教、不同的性别文化，甚至不同的家庭文化都可能为情感提供意义。  
>
>When people come to the conclusion that others have feelings just like them,   
>that conclusion may stem from their own projections.   
>当人们得出结论，别人也有和他们一样的感受时，这个结论可能源于他们自己的投射。  
>
>The assumption that emotions are universal often hides an underlying idealism.  
>「情感是普遍的」這一假設，背後常常隱藏著一種理想主義。  
>
>It is possible to find humanity, even in the absence of universal feelings.  
>即使没有普遍的感情，也有可能找到人性。  
>
>Emotions—our own included—are as dependent on our culture as our clothes, our language, and the foods we feed our children.  
>情绪——包括我们自己的情绪——就像我们的衣服、我们的语言和我们给孩子喂的食物一样取决于我们的文化。
