## 0805 Chinese Writing, Grammar Learning and Reading System Setup

>When someone is properly grounded in life, they shouldn't have to look outside themselves for approval.  
>--Epictetus

✍️ Tried writing [blog post in Chinese](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/08/05/thinking.html); worked on it until **10:40**  
💭 I think I love the feeling of thinking and writing.

📗 Continued learning [English grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter07.html) (Chapter 07)
    
>### **Notes**: 
>英语的修饰语有两种词类：形容词和副词。  
>   
>alike 和 alone 是 a- 开头的古英语形容词  
>古英语 a- 的词首代表一种暂时性的状态，所以这两个词除了可以放在补语位置外，如要用在名词短语中，只能放在名词后面。  
>- John and his brother alike are unreliable. （约翰和他弟弟都不可靠。）  
>- Money alone cannot solve our problem.（光靠钱解决不了我们的问题。）  

🎯 Found the best way to **read English books** — 
1. Use [1Paragraph](https://1paragraph.app/)
2. Translate English to Chinese with [Immersive Translate](https://immersivetranslate.com/zh-Hans/)
3. Generate a PDF (or convert to EPUB)
4. Read it on iPad or iPhone

📰 **14:30** Browsed Hacker News for a while on [*Buzzing*](https://www.buzzing.cc/)

😅 **15:00** Finally did some work — updated the expo recruiting brochure

📖 **15:30** Read *Between Us* — Chapter 1: Lost in Translation

>### **Notes**:  
>I believed that, deep down, all people would turn out to have emotions just like mine. I no longer do.  
>
>Any community that provides a set of experiences, understandings of the world, relationship practices,   
>moral sensitivities, and values and goals may shape the emotions we have as individuals.   
>Different cohorts, different socioeconomic groups, different religions, different gender cultures,   
>and even different family cultures may provide emotions with their meaning.  
>
>When people come to the conclusion that others have feelings just like them,   
>that conclusion may stem from their own projections.
>
>The assumption that emotions are universal often hides an underlying idealism.  
>
>It is possible to find humanity, even in the absence of universal feelings.   
>
>Emotions—our own included—are as dependent on our culture as our clothes, our language, and the foods we feed our children.
