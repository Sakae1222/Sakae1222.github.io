## 0730 Another day with seemingly no work to do

🚰 09:00 Grabbed a cup of water and started slacking off.

💡 Since I figured I could learn some skills on company time, especially video editing, I'm planning to study some [grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter04.html) today and then dive into video editing ✂

💭 My boss is so annoying... always has to chime in on everything everyone says, acting like he's so capable...

📸 Halfway through my book, I started looking at the model photos from this weekend's shoot - they came out really nice!

🚾 10:35 Went to get water and hit the bathroom.

🖨️ Came back and printed out a draft of the presentation materials for my boss, then continued with grammar study.

💬 Had a chat with GPT about strategic ways to stay employed while focusing on personal development (learning programming for side hustles)

💥 Discovered a link I saved earlier that can generate a blog with one click - love it! Spent time tinkering with it until lunch.

🍽️ After lunch, went out to deposit some money - my emergency fund savings progress has reached 50%

💥 Continued editing the blog and realized the markdown I learned through Obsidian is actually coming in handy.
