## 250730 Another day with seemingly no work to do, but I built my blog

> This blog post is written with the assistance of AI tools (Claude & ChatGPT) for translation.

🚰 **09:00** Grabbed a cup of water and started slacking off.

💭 Since I figured I could learn some skills on company time, especially video editing, I'm planning to study some [grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter04.html) (Chapter 04) today and then dive into video editing ✂️

💭 My boss is so annoying... always has to chime in on everything everyone says, acting like he's so capable...

📸 Halfway through the grammar book, I started looking at the model photos from this weekend's shoot - they came out really nice!

🚾 **10:35** Went to get water and hit the bathroom

🖨️ Came back and printed out a draft of the presentation materials for my boss, then continued with grammar study

💭 Had a chat with GPT about strategic ways to stay employed while focusing on personal development (learning programming for side hustles)

💥 Discovered a [link](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) I saved earlier that can generate a blog with one click - love it! Spent time tinkering with it until lunch

🍽️ Lunch

💰 12:30 Went out to deposit some money - my emergency fund savings progress has reached 50%😆

💥 Continued editing the blog and realized the markdown I learned through Obsidian is actually coming in handy!

💭 Planning to use this one-click generated blog specifically as my worklog, and once I build my proper personal blog, I'll link it over.

📕 Continued reading the [grammar book](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter05) (Chapter 05)

💥 Read Chad's Blog source [code](https://github.com/chadbaldwin/chadbaldwin.github.io)

📓 **15:30** Wrote some daily notes in my [Nolty Gold](https://nolty.jp/gold/)

🎬 Started to learn [how to use Adobe Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/jp/learn/premiere-pro?learnIn=1)

🚾 **15:50** Went to get water and hit the bathroom

🏄‍♀️ **16:40** Spent the rest of the day browsing online - mostly others' blogs
