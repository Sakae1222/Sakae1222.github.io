## 0813 Cloudy day doesn't make me blue

This morning, I had a nice run with my girlfriend. If possible, I’d like to run with her every day.  
And I finally got approved by [the Chinese Mastodon instance](https://m.cmx.im/explore).

It’s the first day of Obon, and also the day of a high school baseball tournament match at Koshien, so there were many more people on the train than on a regular workday.    
When I arrived at the office, my colleague was watching my favorite anime, BLEACH, which made me happy.

There’s still nothing to do today, as usual.  
I will continue learning Adobe Premiere Pro and studying English grammar.  
Maybe also read some blogs and books.

#### 📚 **To read:**

1. Tim Wu [*The Attention Merchants*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11AlG-0Yo5NYfDtKoZNnN6rjhg9Crxc42/view?usp=sharing)
2. Paul Graham [《黑客与画家》](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrYpKKAdMy9409DuRHPa-QXFhDan_at4/view?usp=sharing)

✂️ **10:00** Learnt how to use Adobe Premiere Pro and tried to make [a short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ew_hOWBE2Q2Ew_dS11YFxNQTjMpTEYvj/view?usp=sharing)  
💭 I didn't take my wired earphone to the office, so I didn't check the audio of this short video.

📖 **11:20** Started reading *The Attention Merchants* Part 1 Chapter 1

>**Notes:**
>
>Every instant of every day we are bombarded with information. In fact, all complex organisms, especially those with brains, suffer from information overload. Our eyes and ears receive lights and sounds (respectively) across the spectrums of visible and audible wavelengths; our skin and the rest of our innervated parts send their own messages of sore muscles or cold feet. All told, every second, our senses transmit an estimated 11 million bits of information to our poor brains, as if a giant fiber-optic cable were plugged directly into them, firing information at full bore. In light of this, it is rather incredible that we are even capable of boredom.

🏕️ The Omihachiman things made me really want to [go camping](https://www.qkamura.or.jp/ohmi/camp/), so I did some research.  
☝️ This campsite is where I went camping for the first time when I was a language school student in autumn 2020.

🖼️ I must delete the photos I don't need, so I downloaded the app [Slidebox](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/slidebox-%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC/id984305203) that I used before.

📖 Found new open-source software called [NeoDB](https://neodb.social/discover/) which can replace Douban    
☝️ I will use it to manage my collections, including books, movies, music, podcasts, games, and so on.

😪 Drowsy until **13:40**

📖 **14:00** Restarted reading the book

🔀 Switched my phone’s language from Japanese to English

📑 Started learning [English grammar](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter08.html)
