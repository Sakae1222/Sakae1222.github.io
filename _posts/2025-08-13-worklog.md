## 0813 Cloudy day doesn't make me blue

>On the occasion of every accident that befalls you, remember to turn to yourself and inquire what power you have for turning it to use.

This morning, I had a nice run with my girlfriend. If possible, I’d like to run with her every day.  
And I finally got approved by [the Chinese Mastodon instance](https://m.cmx.im/explore).

It’s the first day of Obon, and also the day of a high school baseball tournament match at Koshien, so there were many more people on the train than on a regular workday.    
When I arrived at the office, my colleague was watching my favorite anime, BLEACH, which made me happy.

There’s still nothing to do today, as usual.  
I will continue learning Adobe Premiere Pro and studying English grammar.  
Maybe also read some blogs and books.

### 📚 **To read:**

1. Tim Wu [The Attention Merchants — The Epic Scramble to Get Inside Our Heads](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11AlG-0Yo5NYfDtKoZNnN6rjhg9Crxc42/view?usp=sharing)
2. Paul Graham [黑客与画家](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QrYpKKAdMy9409DuRHPa-QXFhDan_at4/view?usp=sharing)

✂️ **10:00** Learnt how to use Adobe Premiere Pro and tried to make [a short video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ew_hOWBE2Q2Ew_dS11YFxNQTjMpTEYvj/view?usp=sharing)  
💭 I didn't take my wired earphone to the office, so I didn't check the audio of this short video.

📖 **11:20** Started reading *The Attention Merchants*

🏕️ The Omihachiman things made me really want to [go camping](https://www.qkamura.or.jp/ohmi/camp/), so I did some research.  
☝️ This campsite is where I went camping for the first time when I was a language school student in autumn 2020.

🖼️ I must delete the photos I don't need, so I downloaded the app [Slidebox](https://apps.apple.com/jp/app/slidebox-%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%83%88%E3%82%AF%E3%83%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%8A%E3%83%BC/id984305203) that I used before.

📖 Found new open-source software called [NeoDB](https://neodb.social/discover/) which can replace Douba  
☝️ I will use it to manage my collections, including books, movies, music, podcasts, games, and so on.

😪 Drowsy until **13:40**

📖 **14:00** Restarted reading the book
