## 1209 Started reading a English book

I want to learn English by reading English books more efficiently. 
I just realized that reading difficult English books while constantly using a translator doesn’t make sense for my English study.
So I asked ChatGPT for some advice about reading in English. Now I’m starting a children’s book called *Charlotte’s Web*.
