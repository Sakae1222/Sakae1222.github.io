## 1126 

I don’t know why, but it seems like I didn’t push the blog post I wrote yesterday correctly.
So I will finish my kendo diary from last week tonight after I get back home.
But if I’m too lazy to look for things to do, I’ll finish it during work today.

🚶‍♂️ **09:25** Started today by reading a Pudding article — [What it's like to walk across Massachusetts?](https://pudding.cool/2025/10/walk/)

>Live Simply, Expect Little, Give Much

After a few days, the boss came to the office again and made the place noisier. I want to change my career as soon as possible.
There’s still no work to do, so I’ll write blog posts this afternoon.

📝 **13:30** Started writing kendo diary

📖 **14:24** Read Noema magazine — [The Moral Authority of Animals](https://www.noemamag.com/the-moral-authority-of-animals/)

🌞 **15:45** Woke up

📝 **17:20** Wrote a blog post about three good things
