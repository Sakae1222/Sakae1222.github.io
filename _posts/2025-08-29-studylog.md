## 0829 Head First HTML and CSS — Study Log #4

#### Chapter 5. *Adding Images to your Pages: Meeting the Media*

- Use the `<img>` element to place images in your web page.

- Only three of those formats are commonly used on the Web: JPEG, PNG, and GIF.

- JPEG is a “**lossy**” format and is great for photos
  
- PNG and GIF are “**lossless**” formats.
  - GIF is the original image format of the Web. (only 256 colors)
  - PNG can represent complex images like JPEG and also is lossless like GIF.
  - GIF and PNG: great for logos and text images
  - PNG: transparency as well as lots of colors.
    - PNG-24 supports millions of colors
    - PNG-16 supports thousands of colors
    - PNG-8 supports 256 colors

- You can also put a URL in your `src` attribute.
- Images are stored on web servers right alongside HTML pages, so every image on the Web has its own URL, just like web pages do.

- The `alt` attribute of an `<img>` element is a meaningful description of the image.  
  It is displayed in some browsers if the image can’t be located, and is used by screen readers to describe the image for the visually impaired.
  
- If you’re placing a transparent image in your web page, make sure the matte color of the image matches the background color of your web page.

- A width of less than **800** pixels is a good rule of thumb for the size of photo images in a web page.

- Images can be used as links to other web pages.  
  To create a link from an image, use the `<img>` element as the content of an `<a>` element, and put the link in the href attribute of the `<a>` element.
