## 1204 I hate the wind

Today is the last day of my three-day fieldwork. The weather is better than yesterday (it rained), but the wind is strong. There are also so many clouds in the sky. 
I prayed for the sun to come out from behind the clouds to keep me warm. But even though the sunshine was warm, the wind just wouldn’t stop. I was so cold I felt like I was going to die.
