## 0822 Friday is for Reading and Learning 

Continuing to read or learn brings silence and peace to my soul.

Since high school graduate girls are still on vacation, I had to take calls all day again.  
Calls I took today: ☎☎☎☎☎☎　☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎

📗 **09:40** Continued learning English grammar

😿 My leg muscles were a little sore, which made it hard for me to concentrate.

💭 I read some articles about color and tried to change the colors on my flyers, but I wasn’t satisfied with the result.

📝 **14:20** Structured weekly and monthly goals on paper

📗 **15:10** Studied English grammar — [Chapter 14](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter14.html)

🪽 Read some blog posts written by engineers

📖 **16:20** Read *Between us* Chapter 7

>**Notes:**
>
>Doing emotions in a different culture can be learned but, for most people, it will take more than a lifetime. This may also be true when it comes to emotion perception.
>
>Even a relatively brief exposure to another culture affects the way we do emotions.
>
>Biculturals, in other words, may provide a clear model for the OUtside-in nature of emotions that holds for all of us:
>our emotions are attuned to specific situations whether defined by culture, gender, type of relationship, or something else.
>
>Practice makes better, and this is not merely the case for immigrants.
>It is possible for anybody to learn and become attuned to other contexts.

🏄‍♀️**17:10** Found that there is no time to learn HTML and CSS, So I decided to surf until I get off work.
