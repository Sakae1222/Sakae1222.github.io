- `JOIN` will combine rows from different tables if the join condition is true.
- `LEFT JOIN` will return every row in the left table, and if the join condition is not met, NULL values are used to fill in the columns from the right table.
- `Primary key` is a column that serves a unique identifier for the rows in the table.
- `Foreign key` is a column that contains the primary key to another table.
- `CROSS JOIN` lets us combine all rows of one table with all rows of another table.
- `UNION` stacks one dataset on top of another.
- `WITH` allows us to define one or more temporary tables that can be used in the final query.
