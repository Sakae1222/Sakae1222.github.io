## 1031 

I built my blog with Hugo last night. 
So the first thing I did today was chat with ChatGPT and decide how to organize my new blog, where I’ll journal my life.
I’ll buy a domain name after I’ve written a few posts and build my blog the way I envision it.
I will post my monthly summary, life in Japan, keiko diary, study notes, and anything else I want to share.
I want to leave more digital footprints on the internet.

✍️ **10:35** Wrote a summary of my october

😠 **11:05** Something’s wrong with InDesign and it’s driving me crazy.
