## 1031 Worked on InDesign Bug, Wrote Some Blog Pages, and Summarized October

I built my blog with Hugo last night. 
So the first thing I did today was chat with ChatGPT and decide how to organize my new blog, where I’ll journal my life.
I’ll buy a domain name after I’ve written a few posts and build my blog the way I envision it.
I will post my monthly summary, life in Japan, keiko diary, study notes, and anything else I want to share.
I want to leave more digital footprints on the internet.

✍️ **10:35** Wrote a summary of my october

😠 **11:05** Something’s wrong with InDesign and it’s driving me crazy.

🖥️ **14:50** Finally fixed it

😫 I can’t concentrate on my work again — the trouble drained so much energy that I feel completely exhausted.

⌨️ I wrote some Markdown files so I can upload and build my blog quickly when I get home.

📖 **16:55** Started reading *如何成为不完美主义者*

📘 **17:36** Finished reading chapter 9
