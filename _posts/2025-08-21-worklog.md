## 0821 Took calls all day and began a systematic study of HTML and CSS

The first call was from my boss, and no one answered it, which made me realize that the high school graduate girl had a day off today. 
So the calls became my responsibility, since no one else wanted to take them.

#### Calls I took today: ☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎　☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎☎

📖 **09:30** Read the book while paying attention to the indicator light on the office phone

🖱️ Actually, I was fixing flyers at the same time. I think my multitasking skills have improved.

>**Notes:**
>
>Since the time the serpent in the Garden of Eden influenced Eve and Eve in turn persuaded Adam, the world has tried to find out ways and means of controlling human behavior.
>In advertising, we call the process selling.
>
>Through its variously “scientific” techniques like demand engineering, branding, or targeting, the advertising industry had become an increasingly efficient engine for converting attention into revenue.

🖱️ **11:20** Learned [how to add NOISE (GRAIN) TEXTURE](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/PjyiaUozUqw)]

📖 **13:40** Finished reading *The Attention Merchants* Chapter 4

🖥️ Continued learning CSS 

>**The section I learned today:**
>- [The box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Box_model)

😪 **13:50** Felt sleepy

🏳️ I found that [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/) can’t help me learn CSS in an organized way, 
so I plan to read [*Head First HTML and CSS*](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FlczCSwqzeeMhv2hkBOERV8zINH-Adhq/view?usp=sharing) to study it more efficiently.  
💭 I’ll write blog posts like [this](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/08/21/studylog.html) to keep notes on what I learn from this book.

🤩 It's absolutely a wonderful book, just as everyone says. I read it and studied HTML and CSS until **16:50**.

🐟 Learned too many things, so I rested until the end of work time.
