## 1212 My flight got canceled again

I lost everything I wrote this morning and I don’t know why.
I did some work and started reading the book.

Reading a book while doing some work wasn’t a good idea, even if the work didn’t really require much focus.

📖 **13:05** Continued reading *Charlotte's Web*
