>The love that you withhold is the pain that you carry.  
>— Ralph Waldo Emerson

>Prices are driven by perception and social dynamics, so only time will show if they collapse.  
>There is no ‘objective reality’; the perception of value and actual value are the same thing.  
>— [Dror Poleg](https://www.drorpoleg.com/are-we-in-a-bubble/?ref=DenseDiscovery-354)

>**Notes:**

>Rule #2: Be So Good They Can't Ingnore You (Or, the Importance of Skill)
>
>The craftsman mindset, a focus on what value you’re producing in your job.  
>The passion mindset, a focus on what value your job offers you.
>
>Irrespective of what type of work you do, the craftsman mindset is crucial for building a career you love.
>
>Whereas the craftsman mindset focuses on what you can offer the world, the passion mindset focuses instead on what the world can offer you. This mindset is how most people approach their working lives.
>
>Regardless of how you feel about your job right now, adopting the craftsman mindset will be the foundation on which you’ll build a compelling career.

📖 **14:25** Finished reading Chapter 4 and started reading *The Attention Merchants* Chapter 13

>**Notes:**
>
>Technology always embodies ideology, and the ideology in question was one of difference, recognition, and individuality.
>But commerce bows to none, taking its opportunities wherever they may lie.
>
>When you think of it, channel surfing, or grazing, is a bizarre way to spend your time and attention.

📖 **15:00** Completed Part Ⅱ

📗 Started studying English Grammar 

💭 These days I've been reading too many people's blogs, but I still haven't built my own - a real personal blog. I will do it after getting my laptop back.

📗 Completed [Chapter 17](https://llwslc.github.io/grammar-club/content/Chapter17.html)

📰 **16:10** Started reading the articles earlier

😠 Why won't anyone except me take the damn call?  
💢 And I'm also annoyed that the university graduate always glances at my screen — it seems like she wants to know what I'm doing.

📖 There's nothing to do, so I continued reading *So Good They Can't Ignore You* Chapter 5 & 6

>**Notes:**
>
>TRAITS THAT DEFINE GREAT WORK:
>1. Creativity
>2. Impact
>3. Control
>
>Most jobs don’t offer their employees great creativity, impact, or control over what they do and how they do it.
>
>Basic economic theory tells us that if you want something that’s both rare and valuable, you need something rare and valuable to offer in return—this is Supply and Demand 101.
>
>**THE CAREER CAPITAL THEORY OF GREAT WORK**
>- The traits that define great work are rare and valuable.
>- Supply and demand says that if you want these traits you need rare and valuable skills to offer in return. Think of these rare and valuable skills you can offer as your career capital.
>- The craftsman mindset, with its relentless focus on becoming “so good they can’t ignore you,” is a strategy well suited for acquiring career capital.
>  This is why it trumps the passion mindset if your goal is to create work you love.
>
>**THREE DISQUALIFIERS FOR APPLYING THE CRAFTSMAN MINDSET**
>- The job presents few opportunities to distinguish yourself by developing relevant skills that are rare and valuable.
>- The job focuses on something you think is useless or perhaps even actively bad for the world.
>- The job forces you to work with people you really dislike.
