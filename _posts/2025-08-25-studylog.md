#### Chapter 3. *Building Blocks: Web Page Construction*

- `<q>` `<a>` and `<em>` are inline elements
- Remember: block elements stand on their own; inline elements go with the flow.
- Block elements are often used as the major building blocks of your web page, while inline elements usually mark up small pieces of content.
- The `<br>` element is an element that doesn’t have any content, because it’s just meant to be a linebreak.
- `<br>` `<img>` — void elements
- "Void" comes from computer science and means “no value.”
- - unordered list = ul
  - ordered list = ol
  - list item = li
- `<ol>` `<li>` — block element
- another list type: definition lists — `<dt>`= definition term, `<dd>`= definition description
- When we put one element inside another element, we call that **nesting**.
- By keeping nesting in mind, you can avoid mismatching your tags and be sure that your HTML will work in all browsers.
- **character entity**
- - `&lt;` = `<`
  - `&gt;` = `>`
  - `&amp;` = `&`
- `&lt;html&gt;` = `<html>`
- Here's an exhaustive list about all those other symbols and foreign characters — [Unicode 16.0 Character Code Charts](https://www.unicode.org/charts/)

- Whenever possible, use elements to tell the browser what your content means.

    <title>My trip around the USA on a Segway</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Segway'n USA</h1>
    <p>Documenting my trip around the US on my very own Segway!</p>

    <h2>August 20, 2012</h2>
    <img src="images/segway1.jpg">
    <p>
        Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Walla Walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic City, ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful, UT</li>
        <li>Last Chance, CO</li>
        <li>Truth or Consequences, NM</li>
        <li>Why, AZ</li>
    </ol>
    
    
    <h2>July 14, 2012</h2>
    <p>
        I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        Passing cars,<br>
        When you can't see,<br>
        May get you,<br>
        A glimpse,<br>
        Of eternity.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        I definitely won't be passing any cars.
    </p>

    <h2>June 2, 2012</h2>
    <img src="images/segway2.jpg">
    <p>
        My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everything packed and ready to go. Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>cellphone</li>
        <li>iPod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li>
        <li>and a protein bar</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway.</q>
