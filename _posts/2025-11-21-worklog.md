## 1121 Thought about my reading habits

These days I haven’t been reading as fast as last month. I also barely read or learn programming during work hours.
I wonder if there’s a peak, and that after passing it, I won’t be able to get any better.
But after chatting with Claude, I realized there might be natural fluctuations, and that I can do something to keep my reading speed steady by following its advice.
- **Set a minimum daily habit**. Actually, there were days when I didn’t even read one page.
- **Read at optimal times**. I know that the blogger James reads in the morning. Maybe I can try the same — read right after waking up.
- **Vary difficulty levels**. This is really important. Recently I’ve been working on *One Hundred Years of Solitude*（《百年孤独》）, so maybe I should read something easier first.
- **Remove friction**. Okay, this didn’t work. I put my Kindle beside my pillow and always carry it in my bag, but I still reach for my phone instead of reading. Maybe stopping myself from touching my phone is the real key.
- **Track without pressure**. I haven’t been tracking how many pages I read per day, and maybe I should. I can track my mood for the day and how many pages I read.
- **Accept the fluctuations**. I think this is similar to the idea of being an “unperfectist.” Maybe the first step is to stop feeling guilty.

>**Notes**:
>
>研究表明，一般而言，一旦某个人的表现达到了“可接受”的水平，并且可以做到自动化，那么，再多“练习”几年，也不会有什么进步。
>
>有目的的练习的四个特点：  
>1. 有目的的练习具有定义明确的特定目标
>2. 有目的的练习是专注的
>3. 有目的的练习包含反馈
>4. 有目的的练习需要走出舒适区
>
>试着做不同的事情，而非更难的事情：首先取得进步，然后到了一个瓶颈，被困住了，寻找不同的方法来克服障碍，最后找到了这种方法，然后又稳定地提高，直到下一个障碍出现。
>
>并非达到极限，而是动机不足。
>
>一般来说，有意义的正面反馈是保持动机的关键要素之一。

It must be the happiest day since I came to this company. 
I ate onigiri for lunch with my colleague, and we bought a cup of milk tea before going back to the office.
We were almost late, so we ran back and arrived at 12:59!
