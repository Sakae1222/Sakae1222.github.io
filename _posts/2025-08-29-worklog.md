>We perish because we follow other men's examples: we should be cured of this if we were to disengage ourselves from the herd.  
>— Seneca

🖱️ First of all, fixed my flyers.

☎️ Took some calls and felt my Japanese listening and speaking skills seem like they've leveled up.

🖥️ **11:57** Completed *Head First HTML and CSS* Chapter 5 and wrote [Study Log #4](https://sakae1222.github.io/2025/08/29/studylog.html)

🐒 **13:00** Realized today is Chinese Valentine's Day, and plan to have dinner with my girl tonight.

📖 **13:10** Started reading *The First 20 Hours* Chapter 5

>**Notes:**
>
>The major barrier to rapid skill acquisition is not physical or intellectual: it’s emotional.
>Doing something new is always uncomfortable at first, and it’s easy to waste a ton of time and energy thinking about practicing instead of practicing.
>
>pick an idea, take out a blank sheet of paper, then try to explain that idea completely using very simple language, as if you’re teaching a beginner.
>The gaps in your knowledge will become clear very quickly, which makes it easy to go back to the source material to learn what’s missing.
>Scott H. Young, a study skills researcher, calls this the “Feynman Technique” (in honor of the renowned physicist Richard Feynman), and it’s quite effective.

📖 **14:00** Finished reading *The First 20 Hours*

👩‍💼 Continued fixing flyers

>RSS is the antidote to algorithm feeds.

📖 **15:05** Started reading *The Attention Merchants* 

>**Notes:**
>
>It is all the same, insofar as everything that captures it enters our mind the same way. But there are differences in quality of attention.  
>The most basic dividing line is likely between **transitory** and **sustained** attention, the former quick, superficial, and often involuntarily provoked; the latter, deep, long-lasting, and voluntary.
>What matters for present purposes is that selling us things relies mainly on the former—on which the attention merchant thrives—but our happiness depends on balancing the two.
>
>The purpose of advertising is never merely to inform but existed to “manipulate human motivations and desires and develop a need for goods with which the public has at one time been unfamiliar
>— perhaps even un-desirous of purchasing."

Tried to display a photo on my page and succeeded.

🖼️ **17:00** Added a picture to my top page — I might change it periodically.

📖 **17:15** Finished reading Chapter 10

💭 After reading How to Read a Book, I consciously sped up my reading — already starting another new book, *So Good They Cant Ignore You*.
