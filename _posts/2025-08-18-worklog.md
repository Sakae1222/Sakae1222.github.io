>Soft living imposes on us the penalty of debility; we cease to be able to do the things we've long been grudging about doing.  
>— Seneca

👩‍💼 **09:20** Continued making the flyer

😸 The tea bag makes me happy; the tea leaves won’t get into my mouth again!  
💭 We need to buy some stuff like tea bags to make our life happier~

📖 **10:00** Started reading *Between Us*

>**Notes:**
>
>Loved ones are special to us, and we are special to them—so special, in fact, that we spend lots of time with them and share special moments.
>We feel love when the relationship is secure and trusting, and when we enjoy open communication.  
>Love means giving attention to your loved one.
>
>Love, especially the reciprocal kind, gives you self-confidence and makes you positive about life; having love makes you more secure and relaxed.
>
>Implicit in love is that the loved one’s unique qualities invite a connection.
>
>*Amae* is based on need and indulgence, rather than idealization or elevation of the partner.
>
>In Asian American contexts, people do not seek active affirmation from others, but they still find it good to know that they are part of a group when the going gets tough.
>
>Three pillars of contemporary American life: **success**, **being in control**, and **choice**.  
>Happiness is so interwoven with the pillars of the American Dream—success, control, and choice—that it is a “right” emotion.
>
>Energetic, active, and bouncy happiness serves you particularly well when you want to make things go your way.
>
>Depression among Hong Kong Chinese meant not being calm enough, whereas among white Americans it meant a lack of excitement.
>Ill-being was related to lacking the happiness that is culturally valued.
>
>**When calm is culturally valued, people prefer others who seem to have “calm feelings.”** (the [情绪稳定](https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E6%83%85%E7%BB%AA%E7%A8%B3%E5%AE%9A/8191876))
>
>We should move away from a model of culture as something outside ourselves that imposes norms on the natural emotions that we have.  
>Instead, we should recognize how we constantly enact culture in our everyday interactions, and how these interactions scaffold our emotional lives.
>
>The emotions that contribute to flourishing differ by culture (and by position), depending on the relationships goals.
>And even if some form of love and some form of happiness are part of flourishing in some or most cultures, the modal types of love and happiness run very different courses.
>It may be better to speak of loves and happinesses in plural rather than love and happiness in singular.
