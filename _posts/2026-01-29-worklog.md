## 0129 

It’s obvious that things won’t be as bad as before if you start doing something.

Yesterday, I tried to send a message to a headhunter. 
Even though she hasn’t replied yet, it still makes me feel better. 
I decided that if she doesn’t respond by 12 o’clock, I’ll contact another one who seems to match my situation.

Let’s begin by reading *The Giver*, since there’s still nothing to do.

🖥️ Learned some **SQL**

- `COUNT()`: count the number of rows
- `SUM()`: the sum of the values in a column
- `MAX()`/`MIN()`: the largest/smallest value
- `AVG()`: the average of the values in a column
- `ROUND()` Aggregate functions combine multiple rows together to form a single value of more meaningful information.
- `GROUP BY` is a clause used with aggregate functions to combine data from one or more columns.
- `HAVING` limit the results of a query based on an aggregate property.
