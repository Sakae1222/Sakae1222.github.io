## 0204 I want my money back!

Yesterday, I had a meeting with a veteran career agent and decided to apply for a position at an aviation company. 
Even though I don’t know if my English is good enough, it’s still good to apply first.

I want my money back！ I sent a lot of mails, I tried.

📖 Started reading *The Giver*

🔖 Finished reading chapter 9 

🔖 **17:44** Finished reading chapter 11

Today, I sent a lot of emails and also sought help from the customer center of the aviation company. I want my money back, and I will do my best. 

I also chatted with AI to organize my thoughts about my career. And I received a letter from the A-rank career adviser, which made me realize I made a mistake by sending an old version of my résumé. But I think it will be okay. 
Anyway I will finish a new one and send it to the headhunter for the position at the aviation company.
