## 0801 Can't believe it's already August!

> ### Here's my plan today:
>- Try a new way of writing this blogâ€”no timeline.
>- Update the recruiting brochure I made before.
>- Finish it by lunch, then spend the rest of the day reflecting on my career.
>- Write a quick summary of last month.


ðŸ’­ The computer made me sick...but I finished my work before lunch

ðŸ‘€ Found [this page](https://sive.rs/book/OnWritingWell) which tells me how to write well

ðŸ”– And read the article author's [blog](https://sive.rs/). Looks like he is learning Chinese.

ðŸ’­ [The way he spends time with his son](https://sive.rs/pa) is wonderful, but I think only rich people can do this.

ðŸ“” When I search for the epub of the book *On writing well*, [a GitHub page](https://github.com/zhengyishiming) came up, where there are many book. It might be helpful later, let me bookmark it.
