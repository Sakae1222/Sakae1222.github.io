## 0929 Finished reading *GTD* and got some work done

💭 I’m so slow at learning IT Passport, I want to do more exercises during work time.  

🖱️ **10:30** Did some work to calm down. I almost forgot how to work.

📖 **13:30** Started reading *GTD*

>**Notes:**
>
>The sense of anxiety and guilt doesn’t come from having too much to do; it’s the automatic result of breaking agreements with yourself.
>
>If the negative feelings come from broken agreements, you have three options for dealing with them and eliminating the negative consequences:
>1. Don’t make the agreement.
>2. Complete the agreement.
>3. Renegotiate the agreement.
>
>Ceasing negative imaging will always cause your energy to increase.
>
>You’ll invariably feel a relieving of pressure about anything you have a commitment to change or do, when you decide on the very next physical action required to move it forward.
>
>Avoiding action decisions until the pressure of the last minute creates huge inefficiencies and unnecessary stress.
>
>Employing next-action decision making results in clarity, productivity, accountability, and empowerment.
>Exactly the same results happen when you hold yourself to the discipline of identifying the real results you want and, more specifically, the projects you need to define in order to produce them.
>
>There are only two problems in life: (1) you know what you want, and you don’t know how to get it; and/or (2) you don’t know what you want.” If that’s true (and I think it is) then there are only two solutions:
>- Make it up.
>- Make it happen.
>
>A vision without a task is but a dream; a task without a vision is but drudgery; a vision and a task is the hope of the world.
>
>**Here are some final tips for moving forward:**
>- Get your personal physical organization hardware set up.
>- Get your workstation organized.
>- Get in-trays.
>- Create a workable and easily accessed personal reference system—for work and home.
>- Get a good list-management organizer that you are inspired to play with.
>- Give yourself permission to make any changes that you have been contemplating for enhancing your work environments. Hang pictures, buy pens, toss stuff, and rearrange your workspace. Support your fresh start.
>- Set aside time when you can tackle one whole area of your office, and then each part of your house. Gather everything into your system, and work through the Getting Things Done process.
>- Share anything of value you’ve gleaned from this with someone else. (It’s the fastest way to learn.)
>- Review Getting Things Done again in three to six months. You’ll notice things you might have missed the first time through, and I guarantee it will seem like a whole new book.
>- Stay in touch with people who are broadcasting and reflecting these behaviors and standards.

📘 **17:30** Finished reading *Getting Things Done*  
💭 I will organize the knowledge I learned from this book as soon as possible. I don’t feel so good. Am I living the wrong way?

🖥️ **17:55** Did some ITP exercises — accuracy 60%
