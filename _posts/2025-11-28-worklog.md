## 1128 Work–life balance at my workplace

I got up at 6:20 this morning. My girlfriend had to wake up earlier than usual to catch her flight to Niigata at 8:40, so I got up at the same time and took the subway 30 minutes earlier than usual. 
After getting off at the station nearest my company, I went to the new Doutor and had a cup of espresso. 
It was my first time ordering an espresso in a café—the cup was so small, and the smell was amazing. 
After the first sip, I knew I liked it. Now I’m sitting in front of my computer, but the taste is still in my mouth. I like it more than I expected.
