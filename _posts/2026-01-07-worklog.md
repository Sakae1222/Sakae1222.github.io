## 0107 Day after day, I read and write

The boss won’t come today, so I’m going to plan my day.  
First of all, I want to learn JavaScript. Then I’ll continue reading my book.  
Maybe I should do some work too.  
In the afternoon, I want to research the companies I can choose from.

🖥️ **09:32** Started learning JavaScript

📧 **10:30** Wrote a email to my kendo sensei

🖥️ **11:40** Finished learning function expressions, but I still can’t understand them very well.

📖 I’ll use the remaining time before lunch break to read my book.

😴 I took a nap after reading a few pages of **Run, Melos! by Osamu Dazai**, So I’ll start my afternoon by learning JavaScript.

📝 **15:10** Wrote a blog post about my training plan for this year

📖 **15:50** Continued reading the book

📖 **17:02** Started reading *Matilda* The reader of books

🤩 The book is more interesting than I thought!
