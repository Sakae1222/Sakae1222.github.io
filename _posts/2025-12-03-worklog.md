## 1203 Cold boring day

Got back to the head office at about **14:30**. 
This morning we talked about eating hot pot together but still haven’t decided on a date. 
But I’m really grateful that my colleague wants to eat hot pot with me.

🖱️ **14:45** Checked the PowerPoint I made the day before yesterday

📝 **14:50** Started writing last week’s kendo diary

⌨️ **15:40** Finished writing the blog post
