## 0108 A reading day

**Today, I want to continue learning JavaScript and reading my book.**

📖 **10:00** Started reading *Matilda* 

😫 The boss talked about the senior colleague who quit last year, which made me feel a little awful.

🖥️ Learned JavaScript

🖱️ Found some HTML and CSS templates

📖 **16:14** Finished reading *Mr Wormwood, the Great Car Dealer* and started reading *The Hat and the Superglue*

📖 **16:45** Started reading *Because of Winn Dixie*

🏄‍♀️ Slack off until the end
