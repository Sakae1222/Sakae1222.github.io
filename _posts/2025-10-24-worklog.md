## 1024 Finished reading a book and had a chill day

💺 Because the damn JR was late again, I didn’t get a seat during my morning commute. I feel a little tired.

🖥️ **09:45** Did exercises on Codecademy

😫 **13:45** Two meetings in one day — really?

🗯️ Chatted with GPT to make my marathon plan clearer

🥵 It's so damn hot

🖱️ **14:00** Finished making the Powerpoint

📖 **15:00** Started reading *Four Thousand Weeks* Afterword

>**Notes:**
>
>Embracing your limits means giving up hope that with the right techniques, and a bit more effort, you’d be able to meet other people’s limitless demands,
>realise your every ambition, excel in every role, or give every good cause or humanitarian crisis the attention it seems like it deserves.
>It means giving up hope of ever feeling totally in control, or certain that acutely painful experiences aren’t coming your way.
>And it means giving up, as far as possible, the master hope that lurks beneath all this, the hope that somehow this isn’t really it
>– that this is just a dress rehearsal, and that one day you’ll feel truly confident that you have what it takes.
>
>**Ten Tools for Embracing Your Finitude**
>1. **Adopt a ‘fixed volume’ approach to productivity.** -- keep two to-do lists, one ‘open’ and one ‘closed’
>2. **Serialise, serialise, serialise.** -- focus on one big project at a time
>3. **Decide in advance what to fail at.** -- strategic underachievement
>4. **Focus on what you’ve already completed, not just on what’s left to complete.** -- keep a ‘done list’
>5. **Consolidate your caring.**
>6. **Embrace boring and single-purpose technology.** -- choose devices with only one purpose
>7. **Seek out novelty in the mundane.** -- pay more attention to every moment, however mundane
>8. **Be a ‘researcher’ in relationships.** -- deliberately adopting an attitude of curiosity  
>Not knowing what’s coming next – which is the situation you’re always in, with regard to the future –
>presents an ideal opportunity for choosing curiosity (wondering what might happen next) over worry (hoping that a certain specific thing will happen next, and fearing it might not) whenever you can.
>9. **Cultivate instantaneous generosity.** -- act on the impulse right away
>10. **Practise doing nothing.**

📘 **15:24** Finished reading *Four Thousand Weeks*

🏃‍♀️ I think someday I’ll run an [ultra-marathon](https://www.runnersbible.info/DB/UltraMarathon.html).

>**Wish list**
>
>- [チャレンジ富士五湖ウルトラマラソン](https://www.r-wellness.com/fuji5/)
>- [しまなみサラウンド](https://shimanami-surround.com/)

📖 **17:00** Started reading the Chinese translation of *The Garden of Forking Paths* using [Reader](https://github.com/binbyu/Reader)
