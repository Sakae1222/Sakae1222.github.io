## 1009 ITP exercise 

🐟 Today I will do ITP exercises, read books, and check newsletters. Since my boss went to Sapporo, I won’t finish the brochure today. If possible, I’ll also try to memorize the ITP terms.

😠 Why can’t I just stop touching my damn face?

📱 Spent my noon break doing ITP exercises

🖥️ **14:55** Finished 100 ITP questions and took a rest

🐘 **15:40** Added a cute emoji to my Mastodon account nickname and discovered a [website](http://www.motions.cat/)  made by the creator of the emoji. 

📖 **16:55** Stopped doing ITP exercises and started reading *Four Thousand Weeks* Chapter 2 *The Efficiency Trap*

>**Notes:**
>
>Rendering yourself more efficient – either by implementing various productivity techniques or by driving yourself harder – won’t generally result in the feeling of having ‘enough time’, because, all else being equal, the demands will increase to offset any benefits.
>
>When there’s too much to do, and there always will be, the only route to psychological freedom is to let go of the limit-denying fantasy of getting it all done and instead to focus on doing a few things that count.
>
>The technologies we use to try to ‘get on top of everything’ always fail us, in the end, because they increase the size of the ‘everything’ of which we’re trying to get on top.
>
>Because in reality your time is finite, doing anything requires sacrifice – the sacrifice of all the other things you could have been doing with that stretch of time.
>If you never stop to ask yourself if the sacrifice is worth it, your days will automatically begin to fill not just with more things, but with more trivial or tedious things, because they’ve never had to clear the hurdle of being judged more important than something else.
>
>But smoothness, it turns out, is a dubious virtue, since it’s often the unsmoothed textures of life that make it liveable, helping nurture the relationships that are crucial for mental and physical health, and for the resilience of our communities.
>
>The undodgeable reality of a finite human life is that you are going to have to choose.
