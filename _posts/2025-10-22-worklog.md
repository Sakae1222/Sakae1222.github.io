👕 It’s a little cold because I’m only wearing a shirt.

😪 I actually felt sleepy until **10:00**

🖥️ **10:10** Had a toilet break and started learning HTML5

🌻 I found learning programming to be so much fun.

🖥️ **14:00** After lunch break, I continued learning HTML5.

🖥️ **15:50** Finished learning Chapter 4 and wrote [Study Log #5](), even though I couldn’t understand everything completely.

🚾 Today I went to the toilet so many times, and I don’t know why. I don’t think I drank too much water.

🫱 My hands are very dry

📖 **16:35** Started reading *Four Thousand Weeks* Chapter 11 *Staying on the Bus*

>**Notes:**
>
>**Three Principles of Patience** 
>1. develop a taste for having problems  
>Life just is a process of engaging with problem after problem, giving each one the time it requires – that the presence of problems in your life, in other words, isn’t an impediment to a meaningful existence but the very substance of one.
>2. embrace radical incrementalism  
>One critical aspect of the radical incrementalist approach, which runs counter to much mainstream advice on productivity, is thus to be willing to stop when your daily time is up, even when you’re bursting with energy and feel as though you could get much more done.
>3. originality lies on the far side of unoriginality
>But it begins at all only for those who can muster the patience to immerse themselves in the earlier stage – the trial-and-error phase of copying others, learning new skills and accumulating experience.
>To experience the profound mutual understanding of the long-married couple, you have to stay married to one person; to know what it’s like to be deeply rooted in a particular community and place, you have to stop moving around.
>Those are the kinds of meaningful and singular accomplishments that just take the time they take.

📘 **17:20** Finished reading Chapter 11
