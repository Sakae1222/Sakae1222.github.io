## 0212 A work day

Yesterday was a public holiday. I spent almost the whole day fixing my work experience résumé with help from my girlfriend. 
Today, I’m going to clear my head, get myself together, maybe read some books, learn some Python, and then continue improving my résumé.

📖 Started reading *The Giver* 

👩‍💼 Did work almost all day and found that making textbooks is purely fun. 
But I didn’t have time to think clearly about what I really want to do. I’ll continue thinking about it.

🔖 **17:00** Finished reading chapter 16
