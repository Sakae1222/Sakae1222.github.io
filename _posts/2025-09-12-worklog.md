## 0912 Learning, reading, sleeping

💭 Still not feeling well, but I think I’m better than yesterday.  
🛌 I didn’t even bring my iPad or Kindle on my commute. I just need more sleep.  
😿 The worst part is, my partner has a high fever and has to go to the hospital by herself.

>**Notes:**
>
>As to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods, ignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.  
> — Ralph Waldo Emerson
>
>Anxiety is caused by a lack of control, organization, preparation, and action.   
> — David Kekich
>
>Your ability to generate power is directly proportional to your ability to relax.
>
>Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop,” which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed.
>
>This consistent, unproductive preoccupation with all the things we have to do is the single largest consumer of time and energy.  
> — Kerry Gleeson
>
>Most often, the reason something is on your mind is that you want it to be different than it currently is.
>
>It’s a waste of time and energy to keep thinking about something that you make no progress on. And it only adds to your anxiety about what you should be doing and aren’t.
>
>The beginning is half of every action. — Greek proverb
>
>Things rarely get stuck because of lack of time. They get stuck because what “doing” would look like, and where it happens, hasn’t been decided.
>
>Getting things done requires two basic components: defining (1) **what “done” means** (outcome) and (2) **what “doing” looks like** (action).
