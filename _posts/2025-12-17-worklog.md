## 1217 Wrote my annual review

I started writing my annual review. After trying the CSS written by Claude once, I decided to write it without custom CSS.

↩️ Then changed my mind，spent the whole morning customizing a timeline CSS

🖥️ **14:20** After debugging my CSS and making sure it worked, I started writing my annual review.

📖 **15:50** Started reading *Charlotte's Web* Chapter 12 *A Meeting*

📝 **17:20** Finished writing [annual review](https://arayr.com/blog/annual-review-life/)

📘 **17:33** Finished reading Chapter 12
