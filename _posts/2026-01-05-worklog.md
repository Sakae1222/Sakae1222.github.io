## 0105 The first workday of 2026

Happy New Year!
It’s hard to believe it’s already 2026. 
This year, I didn’t write any New Year cards, and I didn’t receive any either. 
I think it’s time to stop doing this kind of thing and be kinder to myself—only do it if I really want to.

📖 I found a new book to read called _Because of Winn-Dixie_.   
💭 This year, I want to read as many foreign-language books as I can.

📖 **10:10** Started reading the book

⛩️ **14:10** Went to a shrine with my colleague and talked a lot

😫 **15:00** The long meeting made me very sleepy.

😪 **15:50** I finally woke up from terrible sleepiness — even with my boss sitting right next to me.

📝 **17:10** Started writing a blog post
